We are examining crosstalk between the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and those beyond NF-κB signaling. We are biochemically characterizing crosstalk mechanisms integrating cellular pathways within a network and exploring if such crosstalks have functional relevance for I). inflammation and inflammation-associated ailments, including cancer, or II). for anti-viral immunity.\nWe argue that our crosstalk studies may inform improved therapeutic regimes, which specifically target signaling crosstalk, in the future.",

      "research_interest": "Our research integrates medicinal chemistry and target-based drug design to develop novel therapeutics, with a particular focus on peptides and small organic molecules. We employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines synthetic chemistry, in silico modelling, and biological evaluation.\nKey Techniques:\nPeptide and Organic Synthesis: Solid-phase and solution-phase synthesis of linear and cyclic peptides, including head-to-tail cyclization, partial cyclization, and chemical modifications to generate diverse peptide libraries. Computational Drug Design: Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict and refine target-ligand interactions. Comprehensive analysis using 1H/13C NMR, DEPT, optical rotation, UV spectroscopy, LC-MS, and HRMS for structural confirmation and purity assessment. Biological and Biophysical Assays: Ligand-receptor and enzyme-based assays, including biochemical and biophysical evaluations of activity. X-ray crystallography (in collaboration) to elucidate target-ligand structures at atomic resolution.\nResearch Goal:\nThis project is focused on the design and optimization of peptide-based libraries and small-molecule scaffolds to modulate clinically relevant biological targets. The overarching aim is to develop novel antimicrobial agents, vaccine adjuvants, cancer therapeutics, and gene-targeting platforms. A major thrust of this research involves the use of artificial oligonucleotide-based systems particularly peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as antimicrobial agents with mechanisms distinct from those of existing antibiotics, offering the potential for complete eradication of harmful microbial infections.\nOur lab includes the development of artificial nucleobase-containing PNAs and PNA mimics that function as sequence-specific inhibitors of double-stranded DNA or pre-mRNA, acting through antisense or antigene mechanisms. These synthetic oligonucleotides enable precise manipulation of gene function within cells, opening new avenues for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Notably, we have discovered novel hybrid nucleobases, hypothesizing that these structural innovations can be harnessed to selectively interfere with essential bacterial gene expression. The current project will synthesize short artificial oligonucleotides incorporating these hybrid nucleobases, with the goal of developing next-generation PNA-based antibiotics targeting bacterial transcription and translation pathways critical for survival.",
