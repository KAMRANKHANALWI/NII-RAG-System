    "mission_statement": "The Bioinformatics Centre at the\nNational Institute of Immunology\nwas established in 1988, with immunology as the primary research area. The centre began focusing on various research areas in the last three decades, including systems biology, chemical biology, structural biology, machine learning, and others. The centre has cutting-edge computing resources for use in research projects (the facilities tab provides information about it). The bioinformatics centre awarded PhD degrees to more than 15 research scholars (registration under JNU-NII MoU). Additionally, the centre has both paid and free software/tools for research purposes.\nLab Head\nDr. Debasisa Mohanty\n, Ph.D., FNASc, FASc, FNA\nDirector, NII\nLatest Publications:\nHgutMgene-Miner: In silico genome mining tool for deciphering the drug-metabolizing potential of human gut microbiome\nLatest Publications:\nSProtFP: a machine learning-based method for functional classification of small ORFs in prokaryotes\nLatest Publications:\nSG-ML-PLAP: A structure-guided machine learning-based scoring function for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction\nLatest Publications:\nProsmORF-pred: a machine learning-based method for the identification of small ORFs in prokaryotic genomes\nBIC Lab Photo (2)\n3\nBIC Lab Photo (3)\nBanner_4\nBanner_2\nIMG_5997\nIMG_6307\nGroup_Upload_1\nPoster",

Machine learning based scoring function is being developed for prediction of allosteric inhibitors for EGFR.\nAI/ML-based method has been developed for prediction of genotypic drug resistance (DR) for M. tb using whole genome sequences and identification of novel DR associated mutations. Structural modelling of DR associated mutant proteins is being carried out to decipher the structural basis of drug resistance.\nIn order to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the AI/ML-based methods for prediction of oligomeric complexes of proteins & host-virus PPIs, systematic benchmarking of Alphafold2 and ESMFold have been carried out on newly released protein structures which lack high homology with known structures.\nPeptide-specific (individual model for each epitope) and pan-specific (single model for all epitopes) machine learning models have been developed to predict the recognition specificities of TCR-pMHCs by utilizing only epitope and CDR3Î² sequences obtained from public domain TCRSeq data.",
