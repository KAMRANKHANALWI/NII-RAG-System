      "research_summary": "Projects: Structure-function relationship studies on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FAS) has been regarded as an important drug target against several tropical diseases, owing to the remarkable structural and functional differences between their proteins and the host. Most microorganisms synthesize fatty acids via a type II pathway, while their human counterpart synthesizes using the type I pathway. In the type II pathway, fatty acids are synthesized by multiple enzymes catalyzing different reactions, whereas in type I pathway, fatty acids are synthesized by one single multidomain, multifunctional fatty acid synthase, each domain catalyzing a particular reaction. Interestingly, ACP’s of type I and II pathway share a similar fold, though differ remarkably in their mechanism of function. The primary function of ACP is to shuttle the lengthening acyl chains to the catalytic site of the FAS enzymes. It is expressed as an apo protein (inactive), and modified to holo-ACP (active) by the transfer of a 4’-phosphopantetheine moiety (4’-PP) from coenzyme A (CoA) to a conserved serine residue, Ser 36/37, ACP synthase acting as a catalyst. The acyl chain gets covalently tethered to the terminal cysteamine thiol of the 4’-PP prosthetic group, which in turn transfers the acyl chain to the respective enzymes during elongation. The acyl carrier protein functions in a very different way in the type II pathway, and type I. Structural studies have shown that the hydrophobic cavity accommodates the growing acyl chain in the type II pathway, which expands with increasing length of the acyl chain, while the type I ACP does not. However, a few questions still remain unanswered viz. how are the acyl intermediates recognized by their enzymes. Moreover, in type I fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, the mechanism of protection of the acyl chain by ACP still remains elusive. Yeast, also belongs to the type I pathway, but its ACP can partially sequester the acyl chain, by a mechanism that remains elusive. To address these, and several other questions, we are trying to understand the structure and interactions of some key proteins of this pathway from E. coli, P. falciparum, Leishmania, yeast and human using NMR. We hope, that understanding the structural features that dictate ACP function and its interaction with other enzymes, could offer new avenues for inhibitor design.\nProjects:\n\nIn Leishmania, and other eukaryotes, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondria. Apart from synthesizing fatty acids, an important role of this pathway is to supply precursors for lipoic acid and biotin synthesis. Lipoic acid deficiency is associated with a myriad of disorders in human's, underscoring the need to understand the pathway at the molecular level. Thus, another major interest of the lab is to understand the structure and function of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of lipoic acids, and posttranslational modification of acceptor proteins in Leishmania, E. coli and human.",

      "research_summary": "According to global cancer statistics 2020, the global cancer burden is expected to rise 47% from 2020 to 2040. Due to changing socio-economic scenario and sedentary lifestyle, the Indian cancer burden is also on the rise, therefore an urgent research investment in the cancer field is the need for better-personalized drug development. Tumorigenesis is an evolving multistep process involving genetic and epigenetic changes that provide a growth advantage to cancer cells over normal cells. The next-generation genome sequencing of cancer cells has identified new recurrent mutations, but the exact biological effects of those mutations are unknown. Our laboratory primarily applies biochemistry, molecular cell biology, genetic and epigenetic approaches to study such mutations in proteins and DNA-protein complexes. Nucleosome remodelers, chromatin modifiers(writers, erasers), and readers of histone and DNA modifications are frequently altered in cancer. However, the oncogenic nature and mechanisms of histone mutations itself in cancer are not clear. Histones are not only the packaging material of eukaryotic DNA but also control the dynamic nature of chromatin, essential for replication, transcription, and DNA repair. We are applying the diverse techniques to study the following topics:\n\n1. The role of “Readers” and “Erasers” proteins in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway We are focusing on demethylases and bromodomain proteins, to identify novel synthetic lethal genetic interactions of “readers/writers “protein with DDR pathway genes.\n1. The role of “Readers” and “Erasers” proteins in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway\n\n2.  Understanding the oncogenic and biological effect of cancer-associated histone H3 and H4 mutations Very high-frequency somatic heterozygous missense mutations in histone H3 genes at highly conserved amino terminus residues (K27, K36 and G34) were reported in pediatric high-grade gliomas, sarcomas, head-neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas as well as many adult cancers. H3.3K27M oncohistone reduces repressive histone modification marks, H3K27 trimethylation in trans by altering activities of polycomb repressive complex 2, thus interfering with the developmentally regulated genes whereas H3.3G34R mutation reduces activating mark, H3K36me3 in cis . These mechanisms suggest alteration in gene expression pattern and may contribute toward tumorigenesis. On the other hand, few studies argue that tumorigenesis may likely occur due to genomic instability caused by H3.3K27M and H3.3G34R oncohistones. How differential PTMs of H3K36 and H3K27 may impact genome stability is not clear. Also, the common mechanism of oncohistone mutants (H3.3K27M and H3.3G34R) toward genome instability is elusive.\n2.  Understanding the oncogenic and biological effect of cancer-associated histone H3 and H4 mutations\n\nin trans\nin cis\n3.  Identifying functions of histone demethylases to enhance the antitumor potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell CAR T cell therapy is successful in hematological cancers but its potential for solid tumors needs further extensive research. Therefore, our lab has a growing interest in combination therapy to improve tumor resistance against CAR T cells.\n3.  Identifying functions of histone demethylases to enhance the antitumor potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell",

      "research_summary": "In the mammalian host, invasion of the hepatocytes is the first step towards developing malaria disease. Invasion by infective sporozoites is complex process and not understood very well. How parasite interacts with its host is the focus of my current research. We discovered that during early liver stage development a sporozoite surface protein (CSP) is introduced in the hepatocytes cytoplasm. CSP then shuttles into and out of nucleus of hepatocytes and changes the host transcription profile. CSP export into the cytoplasm of infected hepatocyte requires the presence of PEXEL / HTS motifs. The transport of CSP into the hepatocyte nucleus is then mediated by importins α3/β1 that binds to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of CSP. The NLSs of CSP and NFκB p50 share the same importins. The entry of NFκB-p50 into the nucleus is strongly inhibited in cell lines expressing CSP, and in infected hepatocytes. Microarray data, from a N-terminal truncated CSP expressing cell line, showed that 40 NFκB targets were significantly down regulated. Presence of CSP in the host modifies thousands of host gene transcription that govern diverse biological processes such as metabolite transport, cell cycle, immune responses, cell growth, cell attachment, apoptosis and hypoxia and the overall effect is to enhance EEF growth.\nWe have the following two major areas of interest:\n\n1. Understanding Host-parasite interactions during malaria liver stages development. Our focus is to identify Plasmodium proteins that modulate the hepatocyte cellular functions. Knockout of parasite genes combined with analyses of global changes (using omics techniques) in the infected host cell is used for the purpose.\n   Understanding Host-parasite interactions during malaria liver stages development.\n2. Antigen/Drug discovery. We focus on\n   Antigen/Drug discovery.\n   A] Knowledge based target identification for inhibitor design. B] Known and novel compounds assay (ex vivo and in vivo) to test inhibitor/ drug efficacy. C] Discovery of new antigens from liver-stage parasites and evaluation in animal models.\n\nA multi-disciplinary approach is used to address above issues.",

      "research_summary": "There are increasing research reports which establish the link between human microbiota and carcinogenesis. Pathogenic bacteria and altered microbiota interact with mucosal surface and as a result, epithelial damage can be seen especially in chronic infection conditions. It can be reckoned that gut microbiota-derived metabolites play key role in epithelial damage and carcinogenesis. Recent intriguing data is hinting at a much broader link between microbiota, bacterial infections, inflammation and carcinogenesis. The mechanism of this relationship between bacteria and human cancer is not well studied and understood, hence our laboratory aim to delineate this complex interaction among microbiota, bacterial infections, inflammation and carcinogenesis. We are also exploring the role of bacteria, microbiota and their metabolites in enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Current Projects 1. Towards understanding the link between intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer The gut microbiota is considered as a forgotten organ in human health and disease. It maintains gut homeostasis by various complex mechanisms.The dysbiosis or disruption of gut flora has been confirmed to be related to gastrointestinal diseases such as CRC and other diseases in different organs. Colorectal cancer is a multi-factorial and multi-stage involved disorder. The role of microorganisms that initiate and facilitate the process of colorectal cancer has become clear. Our group is studying the link of gut microbes in colorectal cancer causation. Clearly, more information is needed about the mechanisms through which the microbial community promotes carcinogenesis. Understanding the events leading to the development of intestinal carcinogenesis through gut microbes will provide novel insight into this pathology, and potentially lead to new therapeutic modalities targeting the microbiota. 2. Role of oral microbiota in colorectal cancer progression and Carcinogenesis Recent reports indicate that the oral microbiome can colonize the gut, leading to dysregulation of the gut microbes. Furthermore, the oral-gut microbes create an intestinal inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. Our group is identifying oral bacteria and their metabolites which may be implicated for their genotoxic and carcinogenic role leading to colorectal cancer progression and carcinogenesis. This project is also aimed at studying oral to intestinal microbial transmission and the inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment, induced by oral-gut axis microbes in the gut.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nTowards understanding the link between intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer\n\nRole of oral microbiota in colorectal cancer progression and Carcinogenesis\n\n3.

We are mainly interested in those enzymes/receptors that are important targets for the design of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents etc. The functional studies along with the structural data may provide to design inhibitors/drug candidates for therapeutic purposes. We are using a combination of molecular biology, biochemical, kinetic, thermodynamic and structural approaches such as rapid transient kinetics, mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, fluorescence, isothermal calorimeter and x-ray crystallography to address these problems.\nInterferons induced GTPases Interferons (IFN) are immunomodulatory cytokines that mediate anti-pathogenic and anti-proliferative effects in cells. The guanylate-binding proteins, known as GTPases are among the most abundant proteins induced by IFN-gamma. They constitute two families of GTP binding proteins with molecular masses 47 and 65-67 kDa, respectively. The p47 GTP binding proteins have been indentified in mammals but the p67 GBPs (hGBP1, hGBP2 etc) have been found in all vertebrates including human, mouse etc. In contrast to all other GTPases, which hydrolyze GTP to GDP, hGBP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to a mixture of GMP and GDP, with GMP being the major product. It has been found that this protein blocks the replication of vesicular stomatitis, encephalomyocarditis viruses in HeLa cells and more recently influenza, whereas the mechanism leading to this effect is unknown and it also antagonizes the proliferation and angiogenic activity of endothelial cells on inflammation. However, the antiviral activity is much weaker than human MxA, another group of proteins within the super family of dynamin related large GTPase, which are induced by interferon-alpha. The p47 GTPases act as antimicrobials in cells; they appear to suppress Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium spp . The structure-functional relationship is important in view of understanding how these proteins work at the molecular level. We recently identified an alpha helix of the intermediate domain which acts as an internal GAP (GTPase activating protein) in hGBP1 ( J. Mol.

Misregulation of the dynamic nuclear and chromatin organization is associated with various developmental disorders, cancers and other diseases. Various aspects underlying this intriguing organization, relevant for regulation of transcription and VDJ recombination in lymphocytes, are being deciphered by chromosome conformation capture analyses and other biochemical assays as well as direct visualization of developmentally regulated loci within the nucleus in wild type and genetically manipulated mouse mutants.\nKeywords : Genome architecture and dynamics, Chromatin organization, VDJ recombination, Epigenetics, Mammalian gene regulation",
      "research_summary": "Role of enhancers in genome organization and function: Enhancers are the vanguards of tissue specific gene regulation but the mechanisms underlying their ability to activate specific cognate promoters are diverse and not completely understood. Our recent studies have demonstrated an unambiguous role of enhancer Eb in defining TCRb location relative to chromosome territory. The ability to reposition the target locus relative to chromosome territory highlights a novel aspect pertaining to activity of enhancers which may contribute to their ability to regulate gene expression and adds to the diversity of mechanisms underlying enhancer activity. Further, enhancers are well known as critical regulators of chromatin accessibility. Our observations support the idea that enhancers also influence intranuclear movements of loci relative to chromosome territory. This has implications for understanding the role of enhancers in three-dimensional genome organization and function and provides a useful start point to gain insights in understanding how intranuclear positions of genes change during development.\nRole of CTCF in chromatin organization : CTCF, a DNA binding protein with multifunctional attributes, is an important contributor to chromatin organization. Global analysis by ChIP-Seq and ChIA-PET has demonstrated the presence of several thousand CTCF binding sites in the human and mouse genomes and emphasized their importance in defining chromatin looping patterns critical for specific regulation of genes.  Understanding about the role and mechanisms of CTCF based higher order chromatin organization has emerged based on quest to understand transcriptional regulation. In addition, higher order chromatin organization is also critically important for VDJ recombination at antigen receptor loci (Igh, Igk, TCRa/d and TCRb) in developing B-cells and T-cells and each of these loci have several CTCF binding sites. Considering the diverse and multifunctional attributes of CTCF, current efforts in the lab focus on understanding different aspects underlying CTCF based regulation of transcription and VDJ recombination. Our chromosome conformation capture analysis indicated that CTCF plays an important role in VDJ recombination at TCRb locus. It mediates long-range chromatin looping interactions important for establishment of recombination center as well as facilitates the spatial proximity of TCRb variable gene segments to the recombination center. Our analysis also suggests that even mild changes in the CTCF-based chromatin organization, that may arise due to mutations or epigenetic aberrations, can have profound functional consequences for gene expression.",

We majorly focus on designing anti-TB molecules primarily through a target-based approach.",
      "research_summary": "Bacteria, plants, and fungi have special enzymes to make an important amino acid called histidine (His). But humans can’t produce it on their own because they lack the necessary enzymes. The bacteria that causes tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mtb) makes histidine in 10 steps using 11 enzymes.\n\nEarlier studies — including some from our own lab — showed that knocking out just one enzyme in this histidine pathway can make Mtb much less harmful. Since histidine is essential for making proteins, blocking this pathway could be a smart strategy for developing new anti-TB drugs. To support this idea, we studied the 3D structures of key enzymes involved in this pathway. This helps us understand how these enzymes work and design targeted inhibitors using structure-based methods.\n\n- Structural Studies of HisB and HisC Enzymes\n  In recent years, our team has successfully determined high-resolution 3D structures of two important enzymes:\n\nHisB (imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase)\n\nHisC (histidinol phosphate aminotransferase)\n\nThese enzymes help convert specific molecules in the histidine pathway. For example, HisB converts imidazole glycerol phosphate into imidazole acetol phosphate (IAP). HisB has 210 amino acids and forms a symmetrical structure made of 24 identical units, each with catalytic activity. Its structure looks very similar to that seen in other organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana, Filobasidiella neoformans, and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n- HisC Structure and New Drug Design\n  HisC handles the 7th step of the pathway: converting IAP into L-histidinol phosphate. Like other enzymes that use PLP (pyridoxal phosphate) as a cofactor, HisC has two domains:\n\nA larger PLP-binding domain with a specific folding pattern (α/β/α)\n\nA smaller C-terminal domain\n\nIts overall shape resembles a left hand, with structural regions named palm, thumb, and fingers. The PLP-binding area is the core of the enzyme and includes a seven-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six alpha helices. The thumb, made of three helices, links the other parts together and helps close over the PLP-binding site.\n\nUsing these detailed structures, we worked with chemists and biologists to design a set of triazole-based inhibitors that can block HisB. These compounds show very strong activity (sub-micromolar levels) in lab tests, and we are now testing their effectiveness in live models.\n\n- Exploring Membrane Proteases in TB\n  The Mtb genome contains about 12 membrane proteases (MPs). These are critical for the bacteria’s survival and virulence, especially when facing host immune cells like macrophages. However, we still don’t fully understand their substrates, exact membrane location, or function.\n\nTo explore this, we’ve taken a biochemical, biophysical, and immunological approach. We’ve successfully produced and purified three membrane proteases (Rv2223c, Rv2224c, and Rv2672) using a special bacterial system (Mycobacterium smegmatis) to get pure and uniform protein samples.\n\nMost recently, we’ve discovered that Rv2672 plays a role in breaking down host lipids, revealing another angle of how Mtb survives in human cells.",

      "research_summary": "Title: Determining the signalling and repair pathways that are altered during genomic instability in nucleus and mitochondria\n\nTheme of Research:\n\nA. Development of therapeutics against colon cancer detection: Colon cancer is one of the most common type of cancer in India. A major issue for colon cancer treatment is the recurrence. Recurrence occur due to the development of chemoresistance to the drugs used to treat the primary colon cancer. Using a unbiased screening procedure and multiple mice models we have identified three small molecules (which are FDA) we have identified three molecules which can act to prevent chemoresistance and allow the chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin, camptothecin and oxaliplatin to optimally function (Kaur et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2024). Efforts are being made to use these small molecules for adjunct therapy in cancer treatments.\nA. Development of therapeutics against colon cancer detection:\n\nThere is a unmet need of colon cancerdetection methods, especially in the early stages. We discovered six microRNAs (which were named DNA damage sensitive microRNAs or DDSMs) which were upregulated only in colon cancer cells. Analysis done with more than 410 patient information in TCGA and the biopsy materials of 54 patients from AIIMS, New Delhi indicated found that the DDSMs were all upregulated even in Stage I coloncancer tissues and not in the surrounding normal tissues(Priya et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2021). This microRNA based signature is being taken forward as a potential biomarker for coloncancer detection.\nB. Determine how tumor suppressors recognize the damaged DNA: Human cells are exposed to multitude of DNA damage every day. Our work has tried to understand how DNA damage was recognized by the cells so that it could be repaired by either of the two main repair pathways – homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. We showed that cells have overlapping yet distinct processes to recognize different types of DNA damages. Ubiquitylation of tumour suppressor BLM by chromatin associated E3 ligases, interactions with process specific proteinsand a biphasic mode of recruitment to the site of damage which was dependent on cell cycle – were some of the key determinants of this process (Tikoo et al., The EMBO Journal, 2013; Tripathi et al., Nature Communications, 2018).\nB. Determine how tumor suppressors recognize the damaged DNA:\n\nC. Understanding the role of tumor suppressors in the repair of damaged DNA: Our work had provided evidence that a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between several key proteins involved in the repair pathway allows cells to repair the damaged DNA by homologous recombination (Tripathi et al., Journal of Cell Biology, 2007; Carcinogenesis, 2008; Kaur et al, Molecular Cancer Research, 2010). Subsequently we have provided evidence how the chromatinorganization is acted upon by chromatin remodelers in cells to allow better accessibility of the factors which would repair the damaged genome (Srivastava et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2009).\nC. Understanding the role of tumor suppressors in the repair of damaged DNA:\n\nD. Dissecting the role of protein turnover during cancer development: We have tried to understand the inter-regulation between the tumour suppressors and the E3 ligases during cancer development. We have demonstrated how a well-known E3 ligase in colon cancer development, called Fbw7 a , is allowed to optimally recognize its oncogenic substrates like the oncoproteins c-Myc and c-Jun (Chandra et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2012; Priyadarshini et al., Cell Reports, 2018). Further also determined the mechanism degradation of two tumour suppressors by Fbw7 a , thereby allowing the potential development of a non-degradable versions which can resistturnover and thereby be active for a longer duration (Kharat et al., Oncogene, 2016; Tripathi et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2019).\nD. Dissecting the role of protein turnover during cancer development:\n\nE. Identifying and characterizing the functions of a new mitochondrial helicase: Apart from the nucleus, mitochondria have its own genetic material. We identified a new mitochondrial helicase, RECQL4. We identified how this helicase goes to the mitochondria, interacts with different mitochondrial proteins and affects the mitochondrial replication process (De et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2012). Further we provided mechanistic evidence how RECQL4 enhanced the functions of the sole mitochondrial polymerase, Pol g A (Gupta et al., Carcinogenesis, 2014). Lack of such a functional interaction led to more accumulation of DNA damage in mitochondrial DNA which contributed to the initiation of cancer (Kumari et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2016).\nE.

Understanding the mechanism of the entry of proteins into mitochondria: For long time mitochondrial protein entry was thought to be dependent only on the presence or absence of mitochondrial localization signal (MLS). We recently provided evidence that apart from MLS, there existed another mechanism for mitochondrial entry. Ubiquitylation of two proteins involved in mitochondrial replication, Pol g A and RECQL4, by a specific E3 ligase(called MITOL) on the outer surface of the organelle prevented their entry. This post-translational modification which allowed only the non-ubiquitylated PolA  and RECQL4 to enter the organelle. We demonstrated this phenomenon contributed to the mitochondrial disorders, namely autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) and Rothmund Thomson Syndrome (RTS).Manipulation of the ubiquitylation status of Pol g A and RECQL4 mutants reverted the process allowing the functional reactivation of these proteins (Hussain et al., PLoS Biology, 2021).\nF.

      "research_summary": "Research Interest in Bone Biology\n\nThe skeleton is an organ that undergoes continuous modeling and remodeling to sustain structural integrity and subserve its many roles in the body. Both bone modeling and remodeling are intricate processes influenced by diet, intrinsic hormonal milieu , metabolism, physical stimulus and genetic factors. One of the main interests of my laboratory relates to a condition called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) caused by increased dietary intake of methionine, deficiency of vitamins like folic acid and vitamin B 12 or genetic deficiency in enzymes like cystathionine β-synthase of methionine metabolism pathway. HHCY received increased attention in skeletal biology after its identification as a player between bone mineral density and post-menopause. In Molecular Sciences Laboratory, we use our expertise in bone cell biology to understand the etiology of skeletal conditions during HHCY.\n\nMy laboratory is interested in studying the regulatory mechanisms governing altered osteoblast and osteocyte behaviour during HHCY, with focus on identification of transcription factors that control cellular differentiation and adaptation in response to HHCY. By performing siRNA knockdown experiments in osteoblasts in vitro, we have identified FOXO1, a redox regulator to have a crucial role in the synthesis of osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor that blocks untoward osteoclast activation. By similar molecular approach we were able to identify the role of MyD88, an adapter protein in toll like receptor-4 signaling in the expression of TRAP5b expression in developing osteoclasts. Both FOXO1 and MyD88 are proteins that have been found to be regulated by homocysteine and methionine respectively.\nWe are currently using a variety of approaches to define underlying molecular mechanisms by which homocysteine governs osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis and understand the determinants involved therein employing molecular and pharmacological approaches.\nOur long term goal is not only to understand molecular basis of bone loss during HHCY, but also to provide insight into the pathogenesis of a predominant clinical conditions that affect women in later years – post-menopausal osteoporosis . Post menopausal osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures. We focus on novel interventional strategies that can open a new vista for therapeutics against post menopausal osteoporosis.\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders: Protein misfolding, misassembly, and extracellular deposition are related to a class of diseases collectively known as “conformational diseases”, which include Alzheimer’s disease, prion disease, dialysis-related amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and type II diabetes etc. Most of these diseases are incurable and fatal. The proteins and peptides related to these diseases can self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies with a common cross-ß structure. The human health impact of these diseases has motivated intensive study of the structure and growth of amyloid fibrils. A mechanistic understanding of the amyloid-assembly process will provide new holds and probes for the physiological interactions that cause amyloidosis. This will allow better approaches to the prevention of amyloid formation and new diagnostics for early detection of amyloid-related diseases. Our lab is involve in identifying the important modifications in the protein sequence that leads to change in its folding and interactions with other protein and ultimately leads to its misfolding and aggregation in to amyloid fibril. These studies may help understanding the intracellular events that leads to cell death on extracellular deposition of protein fibril or intermediates of fibril formation which in turn helps in designing specific therapeutic agents targeting different steps of disease progression for the effective treatment of the disease.We also hypothesis that blocking and/or reversing amyloid formation will be an effective treatment for diseases involving organ failure due to amyloidosis. This requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of amyloid growth and the factors that influence the (dis)aggregation rates at all stages of amyloid assembly. We have chosen three diseases: Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and transthyretin-related amyloidosis to address these issues. We also work on to understand the mechanisms and factors that modulate the activity, structure and expression of glutamate transporters and endoplasmic reticulum associated proteins in neurological diseases.",

T Cell Memory Development in Infectious Diseases\n   The formation of immunological memory is a key feature of protective immunity and underpins the success of vaccination. During a primary infection, naive T cells differentiate into memory T cells with specialized immune defense capabilities against future reinfections by the same pathogen.\n\nOur lab focuses on:\n\nUnderstanding how T cell memory forms during the first infection\n\nInvestigating how this memory is maintained over time to protect against secondary infections\n\nWe study pathogen-specific memory subsets, such as:\n\nCD4⁺ cytotoxic memory T cells in viral infections (e.g., Dengue virus, Cytomegalovirus, EBV, Influenza)\n\nCD4⁺ T helper memory subsets in bacterial infections, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nOur broader objective is to uncover the biological mechanisms of these specialized memory T cell subsets and translate this knowledge into strategies for enhancing long-lasting immune responses through therapeutics and vaccination.\n\n2. Immune Response to Neonatal Sepsis\n   Neonatal sepsis remains a major clinical challenge with limited understanding of the host immune response due to constraints like small sample volumes. Traditional whole blood analyses are often skewed by the dominance of specific immune cell types, making it difficult to gain cell-type-specific insights.\n\nIn this project, we aim to:\n\nTrack dynamic changes in immune cell proportions during sepsis\n\nAnalyze associated gene expression patterns specific to individual immune cell types\n\nBy using transcriptomic and cellular profiling, our goal is to build a more accurate picture of the immune system's behavior in neonatal sepsis, which can lead to better diagnostics and targeted interventions for this vulnerable population.",

To do this, we have established longitudinal cohorts of controlled vaccination and virus infection. Besides, we are also using ex vivo T fh model and mouse models to mechanistically investigate the leads generated from our human studies. (ii) Human virus infection .

      "research_summary": "Cell-signaling is a consortium of cellular events wherein the transmission of environmental signals to cells sets off a cascade of reactions that ultimately culminate in changes in gene expression and activity.  One of the major mechanisms through which cell signaling pathways operate is the reversible phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) in Mtb regulate a number of cellular processes including cell division. There are 11 eukaryotic-like STPKs in Mtb , and our lab has been working on analyzing the functional roles of the phosphorylation events mediated by these kinases.\n\nProtein kinases A and B are essential genes that play a role in modulating cell shape, and possibly cell division. Overexpressing of PknA in M. tuberculosis results in a deviation from normal cell morphology with the cells forming an elongated and branched structure, while overexpression of PknB in M. tuberculosis results in the formation of widened and bulging cells. The Mtb protein kinase B (PknB) comprises an intracellular kinase domain, connected through a transmembrane domain to an extracellular region that contains four PASTA domains. We performed comprehensive analysis of different domains of PknB in the context of viability in avirulent and virulent mycobacteria and showed that although the presence of the C-terminal PASTA domain is dispensable in the avirulent M. smegmatis, all four PASTA domains are essential in Mtb .  Work from the lab showed that the stringent regulation of PknB expression is necessary for cell survival, with depletion or overexpression of PknB leading to cell death. Recently we showed that Protein kinase A is essential for in vitro growth as well as for the survival of the pathogen in the host. Although PknA and PknB are expressed as part of the same operon, they appear to be regulating cellular processes through divergent signaling pathways.\n\nProtein kinase G (PknG) has been shown to play a role in the survival of the pathogen in host macrophages by modulating phagosome-lysosome fusion (lysosomal transfer) after macrophages phagocytose mycobacterium, and PknG kinase activity is essential for mediating its effect on lysosomal transfer. We have investigated the role of PknG and PknG mutants in the pathogenesis of mycobacteria in mice, and showed for the first time that the expression of PknG in non-pathogenic mycobacteria allows the continued existence of these bacteria in host tissues. We were the first to characterize PknK and show that PknK modulates the activation of transcription from the promoter of mycobacterial monooxygenase operon, through phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator VirS.\nThe identification and characterization of target substrates for kinases is extremely important to decipher the function of the pathway within the cell. We have identified enzymes N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) to be novel substrates of PknA as well as PknB and demonstrated   that   while   PknB   mediated   phosphorylation   of   GlmU   does   not   affect  its uridyltransferase activity, it significantly modulates the protein’s acetyltransferase activity. In collaboration with Dr. Balaji Prakash, we determined the structure of GlmU Mtb in complex with substrates bound at the acetyltransferase active site, and uncovered unique features in the carboxy terminus of GlmU Mtb . Recently we have comprehensively dissected the role of GlmU Mtb in arbitrating the survival of pathogen both in vitro and in vivo . In collaboration with Dr. D. Sriram, we developed a novel oxazolidine derivative targeting the uridyltransferase allosteric site, which specifically inhibited GlmU Mtb in vitro and ex vivo. Work from our lab showed that phosphorylation of InhA, the primary target of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid and a key enzyme of the Fatty Acid Synthase-II system involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mtb , impacts mycobacterial growth and survival.\n\nThough all the Mtb STPKs have been biochemically characterized and a number of substrates identified, many questions remain to be answered. The role of the extracellular environment on activation/inactivation of kinases has not yet been investigated. Despite the fact that many of the substrates were initially identified to be substrates for one specific kinase or other, most are actually phosphorylated by multiple STPKs. Thus, a key feature amongst all these kinase-substrate interactions is the redundancy of signalling, suggesting a complicated temporal and spatial control over key mycobacterial processes. It is conceivable that many or all of the signalling molecules described here may in fact regulate each other, similar to the cross-talk seen in most eukaryotic signalling pathways.  Our ultimate aim to decipher the signaling pathways in Mtb and determine how these signaling molecules influence the survival in the host upon infection.",

The field of nanotechnology allied chemistry provides the tools for designing a diversified array of nanoparticles based on their sizes, shapes, engineered surface, chemical composition, and, most importantly, the nano-specific property. Harvesting the potential of nanotechnology to induce sustainable anti-tumor immune response is one of the prime interests of our research. Currently, monoclonal antibodies such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4), programmed cell death protein 1(PD1), and/or PD1-ligand (PD1-L) therapy to block the immune checkpoint inhibitors is the promising and successful immunotherapy for cancer. In earlier research, we developed autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex (p-MHC) coated nanoparticle to blunt autoimmune responses without compromising systemic immunity. This nanomedicine modulates the regulatory immune network by converting and expanding disease-specific T-regulatory type-1(T-reg) cells to prevent autoimmune diseases. Inspired by these scientific advancements, we are interested in developing the nanotherapeutic platform based on designing of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) displaying and/or carrying optimized immune stimulatory molecules and empowering professional APCs by delivering stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist to present tumor-associated antigen (TAA). Additionally, using the nanotechnology platform, we will modulate the activity of the chaperone network of tumor cells to elicit tumor-specific effector T-cell response. We consider the multidisciplinary approach comprising of nanotechnology, biochemistry, and immunology to study the complex immunological responses for the rational designing of the nanotherapeutic platform.",

While macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates and protein) serve as the source of both energy and structural building blocks of the organism, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are required for various physiological processes including energy metabolism.\nNutrients, metabolism and gene expression\n\nThe interaction between micronutrients and macronutrients sets the stage for a complex interaction network of different metabolic pathways, the outcome of which will determine the health of the individual. Deregulation of such interaction networks can have long-term effects on health.\nRecent national surveys have identified Vitamin D deficiency as a major form of malnutrition in India. It is associated with metabolic disorders and immune dysfunction.\nVitamin D is required for functioning of multiple organ systems including muscles, bones, intestines etc. But how its requirements and functions vary under different metabolic and pathological conditions is not known. Since metabolic homeostasis involves multiple organs, an imbalance in one system affects others leading to a domino effect. An integrated understanding of the role of vitamin D in intra- and inter-organ interactions that maintain metabolic homeostasis is essential to devise next-generation public health policy regarding nutritional requirements.\nOur work revolves around the premise that the requirements and functions of micronutrients depend on feeding habits and the ratio of different macronutrients in the staple diet.\nTo elucidate the effects of nutrient-metabolic interactions, we employ a systems level approach that integrates multiple organ systems. We use genomics and molecular biology tools to elucidate the effect of nutrient-metabolic interactions in different vitamin D target organs/tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, intestine, and bones.\nMaintenance of metabolic homeostasis by vitamin D (for more details, please see lab website: https://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home ) Recently we have shown that in the absence of systemic vitamin D signalling, skeletal muscles of mice exhibit a glycogen storage disorder characterized by increased glycogen synthase, reduced glycogen phosphorylase and lower glycogen branching enzyme. Glycogen storage deregulation in muscles is also associated with other diseases including McArdle disease (Das et al., 2022). We have also shown that specially formulated milk-based diets could restore muscle energy levels by circumventing the need for glycogen as energy source (Das et al., 2023).\nMaintenance of metabolic homeostasis by vitamin D\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home\n\nMetabolic regulation of gene expression in immune cells (for more details, please see lab website: https://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home ) We are also interested in understanding how gene regulation is altered by metabolism at cellular level. We use immune cells as a model system to study this. We have shown that resting state B cells exhibit increased protein synthesis due to higher levels of mTORC1 activity (Khalsa et. al., 2019, Dev et. al., 2022).\nMetabolic regulation of gene expression in immune cells\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home",

Combining biochemistry, genetics, and computational modeling tools, we have been investigating the role of these cross-regulatory mechanisms in physiology and disease. We are examining crosstalk between the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and those beyond NF-κB signaling. We are biochemically characterizing crosstalk mechanisms integrating cellular pathways within a network and exploring if such crosstalks have functional relevance for I). inflammation and inflammation-associated ailments, including cancer, or II). for anti-viral immunity.\nWe argue that our crosstalk studies may inform improved therapeutic regimes, which specifically target signaling crosstalk, in the future.",
      "research_summary": "A multitude of biochemical processes links the intracellular signaling pathways into an interconnected network. It is this network — rather than individual pathways — that ultimately shapes how cells respond. Due to its complexity, assigning specific roles to individual signaling modules in immune function has been challenging. Using a systems biology approach, we investigate the crosstalk between these signaling pathways and assess their influence on both normal physiology and disease. Our research focuses on the functional significance of such interdependent signaling in two key areas:\n\nI. Inflammation and Inflammation-Associated Diseases\nMicrobial agents activate the canonical RelA NF-κB pathway, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. While this response is essential for innate immunity, overactivation of RelA can result in inflammatory diseases. Separately, the non-canonical RelB NF-κB pathway is crucial for the development of lymphoid organs and immune cells.\n\nWe are particularly interested in how these NF-κB pathways interact with the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, and whether this crosstalk regulates inflammation. Disruption of this balance may contribute to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CAC).\n\nOur approach integrates:\n\nIn silico computational modeling of inflammatory signaling,\n\nEx vivo biochemical analyses using knockout cells,\n\nIn vivo validation in mouse models of IBD and CAC.\n\nThis integrated strategy aims to uncover how signaling networks regulate inflammation and identify targets for treating chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nII. Antiviral Immune Responses\nViral infections activate both RelA NF-κB and IRF3 pathways. RelA contributes to antiviral defense in two ways:\n\nIt promotes cytokine/chemokine production, which helps recruit CD8+ T cells.\n\nAlongside IRF3, it induces type-1 interferons, key antiviral molecules.\n\nHowever, RelA also enhances survival of infected cells, potentially increasing viral replication. In contrast, the non-canonical RelB NF-κB pathway suppresses interferon responses and modulates lymphoid organ function, helping contain viral spread.\n\nWe are investigating how these opposing pathways interact during infection by:\n\nStudying Chandipura virus (linked to encephalitis in India), and\n\nChikungunya virus (a global threat exacerbated by climate change).\n\nUsing a combination of ex vivo cell signaling and mouse infection models, we aim to understand how signaling crosstalk influences viral pathogenesis and explore therapeutic targets for future antiviral interventions.",

These structural principles are being used to develop novel knowledge based computational methods for prediction of substrate specificity of proteins and also for predicting structural folds for proteins in absence of detectable sequence homology. Such computational tools can assign specific functions to various putative proteins in genomes and hence help in identification of novel metabolic pathways and protein interaction networks in newly sequenced genomes.\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway s Prediction of substrate specificity of proteins has been a difficult task due to the lack of suitable scoring functions for accurate evaluation of protein-ligand interactions. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that reliable prediction of substrate specificity can be carried out by combining evolutionary information from large number of proteins of known substrates, with structural information on active site geometry from homologous crystal structures. This work has provided a computational framework for correlating chemical structures of the polyketide or nonribosomal peptide products to the sequences of their respective megasynthases consisting of a variety of catalytic domains. Collaborative experimental work has demonstrated that these computational methods are not only useful in identification of biosynthetic products of uncharacterized proteins in newly sequenced genomes, they can also be used for rational design of novel natural products.\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway\ns\n\nWe are currently extending such predictions of structural fold and substrate specificity to other enzyme families with the objective of developing powerful computational methods for correlating sequence of other classes of biosynthetic proteins to their metabolic products, not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes. Similar computational approach is also being used to analyze enzymes associated with novel post translational modifications like AMPylation, Eliminylation etc.\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks Our research group is also investigating whether knowledge based structural bioinformatics approaches can be used for identifying protein interaction networks mediated by peptide recognition modules (PRMs) like kinases, SH3, SH2, WW, PDZ etc.   Even though, a number of computational methods have been developed for identifying interaction partners of various PRMs, most of these studies have used a sequence based approach and have identified interaction partners based on motifs/profiles obtained from sequence analysis of a known set of experimentally identified interaction partners. Thus the applicability of such training based methods is limited to only those families of PRMs for which experimental substrate data is available. Therefore it is necessary to develop structure based approaches, which do not require training using experimental substrate data.  We have developed a knowledge based computational protocol for modeling structures of protein-peptide complexes and used this protocol to formulate a novel structure based approach for predicting substrates of protein kinases and MHC proteins.  The success of our structure based approach for protein kinases and MHCs encouraged us to develop similar structure based multi-scale approaches for deciphering substrate specificities of other PRMs like PDZ, WW, SH2, SH3 etc.\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks\n\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features Apart from the approach of predicting metabolic and signaling networks based on substrate specificity or function of the component proteins, we also plan to use the systems biology approach of deciphering novel metabolic, signaling and transcriptional networks based on identification of conserved network motifs/modules and understanding their dynamic features.\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features",

These synthetic oligonucleotides enable precise manipulation of gene function within cells, opening new avenues for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.

We trust in the amazing capacity of the body to adjust to the insults/adverse conditions to maintain homeostasis. So far, the role of individual organs or cells has been the major focus of research. However, the detailsof how multiorgan’scommunicate and maintain homeostasis arelargely unknown. Thus, there exists a tremendous scope to learnand discover novel processes. Here at NII, our laboratory is actively involved in understanding such communication processes among multi-organs using the mouse genetic models of obesity and associated metabolic diseases like diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, etc.\nBroadly, our group is involved in learning about the following areas:\n\n1. How do multi-organs communicate in high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders like diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases?\n2. What are the messenger molecules (biofactors and/or hormones) that effectuate metabolic homeostasis?\n   3. Could organ-specific targeting be established as a better therapeutic platform for metabolic diseases?",

      "research_summary": "We are interested in the investigation of the significance, structure, and functional roles of glycoconjugates – which include glycoproteins (GP), glycolipids (GL), glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors, and bacterial-derived capsular polysaccharides (CPS), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans (PG) – in fundamental biological and immunological processes using the tools of chemical biology, in an interdisciplinary manner.\nAmong more than 30 post-translational modifications (PTM) that are known to date – http://selene.princeton.edu/PTMCuration/ , glycosylation is the most complex. Unlike template-driven biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, glycans are bio-synthesized through non-template driven metabolic pathways. Glycans are linear or branched oligosaccharide or polysaccharide chains wherein monosaccharides are connected through a ‘glycosidic bond’. Like nucleotides for genes and amino acid building blocks for proteins, mammalian systems employ a limited number of monosaccharide building blocks for glycan biosynthesis ( Ref : for beginners and advanced level – Essential of Glycobiology, 2nd ed., Varki, A., et al (2009);\n\nResearch in glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry for more than a century has established that carbohydrates constituting the ‘glycocalyx’ on mammalian cell surface govern cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. Glycans regulate biological processes such as fertilization, differentiation, migration, immune response, and homeostasis. Importance of carbohydrates in day-to-day life are established in the context of blood group antigens, tissue transplantation, vaccines against infectious bacteria, drugs for treatment of influenza, and biopharmaceuticals.\nStructure-function correlation studies of glycans have been hampered not only because of inherent complexity, but also by lack of tools to address challenges. While synthesis of nucleotides and peptides could be achieved routinely with automation no such technologies exist for oligosaccharides. Proteins and nucleotides could be visualised using fluorescence techniques but not glycans. However, post-genomic era has seen rapid growth in realization of importance of glycoforms in biomedicine and development of tools to address challenges unique to study of glycans. These include LC-MS based methodologies, development of metabolic glycans engineering (MGE) in living animals, selective inhibitors of glycan biosynthesis, and array technologies (glycan and lectin arrays).\n\nHow do cell surface glycans, either dependent or independent of the protein carrier, regulate biological/immunological processes? How to develop small molecules that could intercept or alter biosynthesis of glycans thus enabling carbohydrate-based drug development?

We apply protecting / de-protecting methodologies, glycosidation reactions, and armed-disarmed strategies for stereochemical control. We employ TLC, flash column chromatography, and HPLC for purifications and NMR (1H and 13C) and mass spectrometry for characterization of small molecules.\nEnzymatic studies: We develop and conduct biochemical inhibition assays – based on absorbance / fluorescence spectrometers – using enzymes in vitro for evaluation of catalysis and inhibition by small molecules.\n\nIn vitro biochemistry: We evaluate effect of small molecules on cellular physiology, including glycosylation pathways, using mammalian cell lines followed by western blotting, immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA, and enzymatic assays.\n\nIn vitro cell biology: We evaluate small molecules for effects using techniques such as flow cytometry and microscopy. We establish cell lines that stably express tagged (e.g. FLAG) cell surface glycoproteins to facilitate their isolation, purification, and characterization.\n\nGlycomics and glycoproteomics: For characterization of glycans from glycoproteins, cells, or tissues we employ enzymatic deglycosylation and reductive elimination. Glycans are permethylated and characterized by MALDI-TOF MS. Alternatively, released glycans are derivatized with fluorophores for analysis by UPLC. We develop novel tools and methodologies to facilitate identification and characterization of mammalian glycoproteome using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS based approaches.\nAnimal studies: Based on outcome of in vitro cellular and biochemical studies, we evaluate our small molecules in multiple strains of mice in vivo for delivery to CNS and modulation of glycoforms of cell surface antigens and its consequences.",

      "research_summary": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are heterogeneous cell populations, comprised of various subsets that collectively provide early innate immunity leading to subsequent adaptive immune responses. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), CD8α + DCs, CD4 + DCs and CD8-CD4- DCs are four major DC subsets in mouse spleen and bone marrow cultures. Among DCs, pDCs and CD8α + DCs produce very high levels of type I Interferon (IFN) and IL12 respectively that help to establish anti-viral anti-microbial states in the body. In a simplified system of DC classification, CD8α + DC and equivalent population from various tissues is classified as cDC1 whereas CD4 + DC equivalent population is classified as cDC2 subtype.\n\nMembers of Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play a critical role in DC development and functions. IRF4 and IRF8 together govern the molecular program regulating DC subset development and functional diversity. Studies from knockout mouse model led to identification of critical role for Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 ( Id2 ), Basic leucine zipper transcription factor 3 ( Batf3 ) in development of CD8α + DC. We reported that Irf8 is upstream of Batf3 and Id2 in the classical CD8α + DC developmental program and demonstrated that Batf3 and Id2 had a synergistic effect on Irf8 directed developmental process ( J. Immunol. 2013, 191:5993-6001 ).\n\nAnalyzing of the effect of Irf8 on TGF-β super family specific gene expression in DCs in lab led to identification of Acvrl1 , a type I TGF-β superfamily receptor, as a gene strongly induced by Irf8 expression. We showed that among various DC subtypes, Acvrl1 is differentially expressed in CD8α + DCs. ACVRL1 signaling augmented Irf8 -directed classical CD8α + DC development. IRF8R294C mutation in BXH2 mice abolishes the development of CD8α+ DCs without impairing pDC development and eliminates production of IL12p40, while retaining that of type I IFNs. IRF8 R294C mutant failed to induce ACVRL1 transcription which co-related with defect in development of CD8α+ DCs in BXH2 mice. Irf8 expression is essential for plasmacytoid DC and CD8α + DC development and ACVRL1 signaling plays a pivotal role whereby it suppresses plasmacytoid DC development while enhancing that of CD8α + DCs, thus contributing to DC diversity development. The major pathways and the detailed biochemical mechanisms regulating the DC development and functions remains poorly understood.\n\nMain focus of my lab would be to understand the role of IRFs in DC biology and examining role of DC subsets in various pathological conditions.",

Microbiome-Based Nutritional Therapy: A New Arsenal Against Toxoplasma gondii-Induced Obesity\n   Approximately one-third of the global population is estimated to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a parasite known not only for its widespread prevalence but also for its ability to subtly alter human behavior during latent infection. In immunocompromised individuals, T. gondii infections can lead to vision loss or severe brain damage. The absence of effective vaccines and the side effects of existing treatments highlight the need for innovative therapeutic strategies.\n\nIn our lab, we have developed a novel therapeutic approach targeting T. gondii by using small molecules that activate host cell suicide mechanisms, thereby eliminating the parasite residing within. Our research further explores how T. gondii infection disrupts the synchrony between the gut microbiome and metabolic rhythms.\n\nWe hypothesize that the competition between symbionts and pathobionts influences the balance between tolerance (Treg/Tr1/Breg/Br1) and inflammation (Th1/Th17/inflammatory B1). Chronic infection leads to persistent inflammation, contributing to obesity.\n\nThis translational research focuses on:\n\nInvestigating how probiotics restore gut homeostasis\n\nDiscovering microbiome-derived anti-inflammatory small molecules\n\nCountering T. gondii-induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity\n\n2.

The recent advances in understanding of tumor metabolism have provided an insight into the metabolic changes that augment proliferation, and, also the diverse mechanistic and context-dependent determinants that can trigger the metabolic reprogramming. The mechanisms underlying the communication between metabolic pathways and cell signalling networks are complex and have key roles in determining disease progression. Studies suggest that most metabolic pathways cross-talk with the machinery that controls gene expression. However, the molecular details of how the cytoplasmic signalling from metabolic state is conveyed to chromatin remodelling for congruent gene transcription remains poorly understood. The focus of our studies is to understand molecular perturbations that contribute to epigenomic-metabolic interplay in cancers. Using transcriptomics, RNA interference and proteomic screens we plan to delineate novel connections between the metabolic and the gene expression machinery. The current focus of the lab is on transcriptional regulators such as various HDACs and sirtuins which drive metabolic rewiring. Elucidating the role of metabolic enzymes such as PKM2, ACLY, SDHA and IDH1 which promote epigenetic plasticity underlying the malignant phenotype is also an area of notable interest in our research group.

      "research_summary": "Humans are afflicted by several autoimmune diseases, the causes for many of which remain unknown. The pathological consequence of autoreactive immune responses are the subject of intense investigation. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical non-organ specific autoimmune disease which generally manifests a life-long, relapsing-remitting phenotype. Multiple organs are targeted; chronic renal failure is a serious consequence, and patients can also exhibit arthritis, neurological involvement and hemolytic anemia. More than a hundred different autoantibody specificities have been described; drawing correlations between disease manifestations and autoimmune reactivity remains a high priority. Anti-phospholipid autoreactivity, a frequent occurrence in systemic autoimmune disease, has been associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombotic events and early pregnancy loss. The immunological and physiological sequelae arising as a result of the release of sequestered hemoglobin in animals prone to autoimmunity form a focus of current investigations. Interestingly, in both SLE patients and in animals prone to systemic autoimmunity, aberrance in apoptotic processes has been observed. Excessive spontaneous apoptosis (or excessive susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli) as well as inefficient clearance of apoptotic debris have been documented in lupus patients, and animals genetically modified to impair the uptake of apoptotic cells exhibit lupus-like pathology. Autoimmune cascades initiated by early autoantibody responses specifically directed towards apoptotic cells are being investigated; since apoptotic debris appears to constitute the original antigenic insult, it is conceivable that such events could have a bearing on pathology. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a placental glycoprotein hormone, stimulates the release of progesterone from the corpus luteum, thereby sustaining pregnancy; successful pregnancy is believed to represent a Th2 skew. Given reports of pregnancy-associated lupus flares in humans and the ameliorating influence of hCG in murine models of organ-specific (Th1-mediated) autoimmune disease, the effects of administration of the hormone in animals genetically prone to systemic autoimmunity (a state which, like pregnancy, can also be notionally considered to constitute a Th2 skew, given associated hypergammaglobulinemia and antibody-mediated pathology) are being investigated. In recent years, hCG has been shown to be secreted by a variety of cancers as well, and its presence has been associated with chemo-resistance as well as with poor patient prognosis. Understanding the molecular pathways by which hCG potentially impacts on tumor progression, as well as the development of novel immunotherapeutic anti-hCG vaccination strategies, form another focus of the laboratory.",

      "research_summary": "Engineering hepatocytes for supporting acute liver failure\nEngineering hepatocytes for supporting acute liver failure\nIndia is placed at intermediate endemic level in hepatitis B. Hepatitis B virus is reported to be responsible for 70% of chronic hepatitis cases and 80% of cirrhosis of liver cases. About 60% of those cases with hepatocellular carcinoma are HBV marker positive. Thus it would be clinically relevant in Indian scenario if a cell based therapeutic option is available for treatment of end stage liver disease cause due to hepatitis B virus.\nTo address these clinical situations, we developed a strategy to generate hepatocyte-like cells (Neo-Hepatocytes; abbreviated as NeoHeps) from monocyte derived from peripheral blood of HBsAg-NAT positive human peripheral blood samples. To generate NeoHeps; non-activated monocytes were sorted from the human peripheral blood by magnetic assisted cell sorting techniques. The monocytes were then cultured in IMDM basal media containing IL3, MCSF and 2-ME supplemented with 0.5% ESC serum for 6 days to generate Reprogrammed Monocytes (RM) at Day 6. The RM were then cultured in IMDM basal media containing epithelial growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF4) with progressive increase in serum concentration from 2% (at day 6) to 5% (at Day8) upto 10% from day 13 to day 21 of the culture.\nBoth Monocytes and RM were unable to demonstrate P450 activity in them. The NeoHeps derived from both healthy and HBsAg-NAT positive bloods have the potential to secrete human serum albumin in their respective culture supernatant like primary human hepatocytes.\nTo evaluate the stability of NeoHeps in vivo, partial (1/3rd) hepatectomy of SCID mouse was performed and NeoHeps were injected near the spleen of the hepatectomized mouse. 10th day post transplantation, blood was collected from the mouse and serum was isolated. The liver of the mouse was excised out, there was no visible tumours found in the liver lobes of the recipient mouse and cryo-sectioning of the liver was performed to check the homing and engraftment of transplanted NeoHeps. Human serum albumin was detected in the serum of the recipient mouse and the immuno-cytochemistry of the liver tissue section of the recipient mouse stained positive for human albumin and connexin32.\n\nWe are developing a novel tissue engineered vascular graft which is immune friendly as well as long lasting as compared to the presently available grafts.\nIn this approach, the peripheral blood monocytes are reprogrammed to stem cell like cell followed by its re-differentiation into endothelial –like cells and vascular smooth muscle like-cells. These cells express prominent endothelial and smooth muscle cell markers as well as show functional activity.\nThe re-differentiated vascular cells are then uniformly seeded onto a decellularized xenogenic vessel matrix using a bioreactor setup such that endothelial cells form the luminal layer while smooth muscle cells form the outer layer of the graft.\n\nThe project involves two steps; in vitro differentiation of PBMC derived monocytes into retinal cells and their further phenotypic and functional characterization by transplantation into a newly developed NOD.SCID-CBA/J mouse model for retinal degeneration. The underlying aim of the project is to discover new options in curing of retinal degeneration diseases like retinitis pigmentosa which unfortunately remain incurable till date.\n\nWe have developed a methodology to encapsulate live Mycobacterium (MIP and BCG) as a dry powder inhale-able formulation which remains viable for 4 months at 37°C. A non invasive procedure was developed to deliver this formulation to small animals.  We have established by a number of in vitro and in vivo experiments that this inhale-able vaccine of live Mycobacterium is more immunogenic as compared to the aerosol of bacilli and it provide better protection in mice when challenged with H37Rv. The alginate coated DPA of BCG/MIP is a very promising alternative for present day vaccination for Tuberculosis; it does not require the cold chain for transportation and storage, it provide better protection than conventional intradermal or liquid aerosol and its delivery does not require the needle and a syringe.\n\nHyperthermia enhanced transdermal (HET) immunization is a novel needle free immunization strategy employing application of antigen along with mild local hyperthermia (42°C) to intact skin resulting in detectable antigen specific Ig in serum. We have developed a tools for HET immunization and have shown that mice immunized by tetanus toxoid using HET route exhibited protection from challenge with a lethal dose of tetanus toxin.",

We investigate the genetic underpinnings of human disorders such as male infertility and brain tumors, as well as the genomics of livestock species, with an emphasis on uncovering novel genes and molecular mechanisms with clinical and agricultural relevance.\n\n1. Y Chromosome Genomics and Male Infertility\n   We have extensively studied genetic aberrations on the Y chromosome in infertile males with normal spermiogram profiles, a group often classified as having unexplained infertility. Our investigations included:\n\nAnalysis of 64 Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs) across AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions\n\nCopy number variation of DYZ1 arrays, DAZ, BPY2, and SRY genes using qPCR\n\nSingle Nucleotide Variant (SNV) analysis and direct sequencing of the SRY gene\n\nKey findings:\n\nMultiple patients exhibited novel deletions and micro-deletions in the DYZ1 region and AZF loci\n\nDespite normal copy number of SRY, mutations were found in 8 patients, 4 of which resulted in truncated proteins\n\nCopy numbers of DAZ and BPY2 were significantly reduced in patients compared to normal fertile males (NFMs) (p < 0.001)\n\nThese findings suggest a shared set of Y-linked genetic aberrations contributing to infertility, irrespective of spermatogenic status. This work enhances the potential for DNA-based diagnostics, IVF planning, and genetic counseling in reproductive medicine.\n\n2. Genomic Alterations in Brain Tumors\n   We investigated genetic and expression profiles in gliomas and meningiomas, with a focus on the proto-oncogene KIT and MN1, along with Y-linked loci in male patients.\n\nHighlights:\n\nContrary to earlier reports, KIT overexpression was observed in 32.5% of glioma cases across both low and high grades (n=40)\n\nqPCR and RT-PCR showed transcriptional upregulation of both KIT and its ligand KITLG, independent of gene amplification (p > 0.05)\n\nKIT gene sequencing revealed non-synonymous substitutions in exons 10 and 17, although their pathological significance remains unclear\n\nFISH analysis confirmed gene amplification in 2 cases and allele loss in 1, supporting transcript-level changes observed by qPCR\n\nThese findings emphasize that aberrant KIT expression is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, underscoring its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in glioma pathogenesis.\n\n3. Comparative and Functional Genomics of Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)\n   To bridge knowledge gaps in livestock genomics, we employed minisatellite associated sequence amplification (MASA) using oligonucleotides based on VNTR motifs (e.g., 33.6, 33.15, GACA, GATA, GGAA, TGG) and cDNA from various tissues of Bubalus bubalis.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nDiscovery and characterization of repeat-tagged, tissue-specific transcripts\n\nIdentification of candidate genes with clinical and functional significance, including in testis, spermatozoa, and somatic tissues\n\nThis work enhances our understanding of the repeat-associated transcriptome and serves as a resource for addressing key questions in functional genomics, comparative genetics, and animal biotechnology.\n\nBy integrating genomics across clinical, reproductive, and agricultural systems, our research contributes to both basic science and translational applications, supporting advancements in biomedical genetics, diagnostics, and animal health management.",

We also investigate how innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, along with microbial factors, contribute to the severity and regulation of experimental colitis.\n\n1. B Cell Responses\n   Our previous studies have shown that:\n\nTNF receptor signaling (via CD27 or CD40) during B cell activation suppresses the differentiation of plasma cells while promoting memory B cell formation.\n\nA subset of IgM⁺ “unswitched” memory B cells expressing CD73 is generated through B cell–T cell interactions involving CD40 signaling.\n\nCurrent investigations are focused on determining the role of CD40-mediated signaling in the long-term maintenance of memory and plasma B cell pools.\n\n2.

      "research_summary": "The research interest of the laboratory is in the following areas:\nRole of non-coding RNAs in regulation of cell-cycle and DNA replication: Emerging evidences suggest that microRNA target genes that regulate DNA replication and cell cycle progression and we aim to determine how microRNA regulate the DNA replication machinery as cell progresses from one phase to the next. Aberrations in microRNA activity has been linked to loss of cell cycle and replication control and this has led to oncogenic functions (thereby called oncomirs) being ascribed to them. Summing up, we are trying to understand the mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate mammalian cell cycle and DNA replication in normal and pathological conditions.\nRole of non-coding RNAs in regulation of cell-cycle and DNA replication:\nRole of non-coding RNAs in regulation of cell-cycle and DNA replication:\nUnderstanding the checkpoint response to aberrations in replication complexes : Whenever genomic lesions are detected during DNA synthesis, they are coated by the single strand DNA binding protein complex, called Replication Protein A, leading to the activation of canonical checkpoint proteins like ATR, Chk1 and p53. Human genome codes for many other single strand DNA binding proteins and we are testing if novel mechanisms of checkpoint activation exist that do not require Replication Protein A. If such mechanisms exist we would like to understand which factors provide the role of DNA binding, how checkpoint proteins like Chk1 and p53 are activated and how signal transduction pathway stalls the cell cycle and DNA replication.\n\nRegulation of replication machinery during stress : It is known that replication factors are downregulated during stress and we have observed that cullin 4-based ubiquitin ligase mediate the proteolysis of Mcm10, a protein essential for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication. Therefore, we are trying to understand the independent mechanism by which mammalian cells effectively inhibit the replication machinery during stress preventing it from drifting towards a catastrophic path of genomic instability. It has been observed that some replication proteins localize to the centrosome suggesting their role in regulation of centrosome biogenesis. Since it is well recognized that errors in the centrosome duplication contribute to tumorigenesis we are interested in determining the role of replication factors in preventing aneuploidy.",

      "research_summary": "Our laboratory is dedicated to uncovering novel functional and endocrine connections between the skeleton and other organ systems, with the broader aim of understanding the molecular basis of human metabolism and its disorders. We use the skeleton as a central regulatory organ and employ mouse genetic models alongside human clinical data to dissect these multi-organ interactions.\n\n1. The Skeleton as an Endocrine Organ\n   Traditionally seen as a structural component, the skeleton is now recognized as an endocrine organ that both responds to and regulates systemic physiology. External and internal factors—ranging from hormonal fluctuations to cytokine signaling—can lead to changes in bone density and overall bone health. A classical example is the post-menopausal loss of estrogen, which accelerates bone loss and leads to osteoporosis.\n\nIn return, the skeleton secretes hormones like osteocalcin, which act on other organs (e.g., pancreas, brain, and testes) and play a crucial role in regulating whole-body metabolism.\n\n2. Discovery of the Gut–Liver–Bone Axis via Vitamin B₁₂\n   We identified a previously unknown gut–liver–bone endocrine axis operational through vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamin). Using a gastric intrinsic factor (Gif) knockout mouse model, which mimics B₁₂ malabsorption, we mapped a metabolic cascade where:\n\nVitamin B₁₂ acts in the liver in a growth hormone (GH)-dependent manner to stimulate taurine synthesis\n\nTaurine is then secreted into the bloodstream and acts specifically on bone cells to promote new bone formation\n\nThis discovery, validated in both mice and humans, reveals a bone-specific anabolic effect of the B₁₂–taurine pathway. It holds strong translational promise as a novel therapeutic target for anabolic treatment of osteoporosis, especially because it selectively enhances bone formation without affecting resorption.\n\n3. Current and Future Directions\n   Deciphering intracellular signaling pathways in the liver and bone involved in the B₁₂–taurine axis\n\nIdentifying additional bone-regulating endocrine factors using multi-organ genetic screening and omics-based approaches\n\nExploring how systemic metabolic signals—originating from gut, liver, adipose tissue, or muscle—modulate bone mass and skeletal health\n\nOur long-term goal is to harness these inter-organ endocrine pathways to design novel therapies for skeletal and metabolic disorders, leveraging both mouse models and human genetic data.\n\nThis integrated approach places the skeleton at the center of a complex hormonal network and opens new avenues in the treatment of osteoporosis, metabolic syndromes, and multi-organ endocrine dysfunctions.",

      "research_summary": "Humans and pathogens (viruses/bacteria) have co-evolved during evolution. The pathogens are known to modulate host cell machinery in a manner that ensures their existence. Host cells on the other hand, mount an antiviral or antibacterial response in the form of devising host restriction factors. Indeed, in case of HIV-1, a number of host restriction factors (Tetherin, APOBEC etc) have been identified. Viruses, however, have devised many mechanisms to overcome these restriction factors and HIV-1 accessory proteins are particularly adept at doing so. HIV-1 is known to modulate levels of key cellular regulators (p53 or components of innate immunity) of homeostasis with significant implications for replication fitness and pathogenesis.\nHIV-1 accessory and regulatory genes (Tat, Rev, Nef, Vpu, Vpr) are multifunctional that govern pathogenesis by modulating p53, via set of miRNAs, exploiting cellular ubiquitination machinery or by their ability to suppress siRNA mediated functions or by multiple other mechanisms, notably being B-TrcP mediated functions of Vpu. The functional relevance of such perturbations is key to understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis. The various genetic subtypes, the extent of genetic variants and their functional  implications among North-Indian individuals infected with HIV-1  genes or the characterization of  host genes that are known to be associated with progression of the disease or the lack of it, are of fundamental importance for gaining insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis and devising novel ways (small molecules, siRNAs, miRNAs etc) to interfere with its replication and progression. Mechanisms responsible for apoptosis, ubiquitination and autophagy  and their cross-talk seem to play an important role in HIV pathogenesis and needs to be studied in detail to gain insight about a remarkably successful virus like HIV.",

      "research_summary": "Our research spans reproductive immunology, cytokine signaling in pregnancy, anti-viral therapeutics, and antibody engineering, with a strong translational focus on vaccine development, therapeutic interventions, and host-pathogen interactions.\n\n1. Zona Pellucida Glycoproteins in Fertilization and Immunocontraception\n   We investigate the role of human zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins—ZP1, ZP3, and ZP4—in sperm binding and acrosome reaction induction during fertilization. Our findings highlight:\n\nN-linked glycosylation, not O-linked, as crucial for acrosome reaction in humans.\n\nThe C-terminal region of ZP3 as its functional domain.\n\nInvolvement of Gi-protein-coupled receptors, T- and L-type voltage-operated calcium channels, and various kinases in mediating ZP-induced acrosome reaction.\n\nBuilding on this mechanistic understanding, we have explored the use of ZP glycoproteins as immunocontraceptive vaccine candidates, demonstrating reduced conception rates in non-human primates. This approach is now being extended to wildlife population management, particularly for street dog control. We have successfully developed a protocol for His-tag-free purification of recombinant canine ZP3 using batch-fed E. coli fermentor systems.\n\n2. Cytokine-Mediated Regulation of Trophoblast Function\n   Proper trophoblast proliferation, invasion, and differentiation are vital for placental development and pregnancy success. Our studies focus on the role of the IL-6 cytokine family (IL-6, IL-11, and LIF) in regulating trophoblast behavior:\n\nIL-11 and IL-6 enhance invasion via STAT3 Tyr705 activation.\n\nLIF promotes both invasion and proliferation, additionally activating the ERK1/2 pathway.\n\nSilencing STAT3 reduces IL-11-induced invasion, whereas ERK1/2 is essential for LIF-mediated proliferation.\n\nThrough cDNA microarray, we identified MMP23B and pappalysin-1 as critical effectors in cytokine-induced trophoblast invasiveness. Our results suggest IL-11 differentially regulates invasion during early and late pregnancy stages. This work provides mechanistic insight into implantation and may inform novel strategies for managing pregnancy complications.\n\n3. Plant-Derived Anti-HIV Compounds and Microbicide Development\n   We are exploring natural compounds from medicinal plants for use in HIV prevention via topical microbicides. Screening of ~30 plant species identified four extracts with potent in vitro anti-HIV activity, targeting:\n\nReverse transcriptase\n\nProtease\n\nIntegrase enzymes\n\nAdditionally, synthetic derivatives of andrographolide and integric acid were evaluated. Several andrographolide analogs demonstrated high therapeutic indices (TI > 500), with potent inhibition of viral entry by binding the V3 loop region of HIV-1 gp120. These findings support the development of plant-based or semi-synthetic microbicides for sexual transmission prevention.\n\n4. Antibody Engineering for Influenza Virus Therapeutics\n   We aim to develop heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for passive immunotherapy against influenza virus infections. Key accomplishments include:\n\nGeneration of 49 MAbs targeting pandemic and seasonal H1N1 strains\n\nIdentification and humanization of a high-affinity MAb (KD = 2.1 ± 0.4 pM) that neutralizes 2009 pandemic H1N1 (IC₅₀ = 0.08 µg/ml), binding the ‘Sa’ epitope on hemagglutinin (HA)\n\nIsolation of single-chain variable fragments (ScFv) from a human phage display antibody library, specific to both pandemic and seasonal strains\n\nThese antibodies offer a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention during severe or emerging influenza outbreaks.",

      "research_summary": "The scientific contributions of my research are primarily in the area of cell biology with special emphasis on the regulation of intracellular trafficking. We have addressed fundamental issues in host pathogens interactions with an aim to develop a potentially new therapeutic target for their intervention. Our work has provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of how intracellular pathogens modulate intracellular trafficking pathways to survive in phagocytes. We have demonstrated using an elegant in vitro reconstitution of transport assay that live Salmonella produce a protein, SopE, that helps recruit Rab5 and NSF on the phagosomes containing live bacteria. This promotes fusion of live Salmonella -containing phagosomes with early endosomes so that lysosomal targeting of such phagosomes is avoided. Thus, it is emerging from these studies that SopE could be a new and specific target for selective elimination of Salmonella from the host cells either by blocking the interaction of SopE with Rab5 or by modulating the content of endocytic GTPases in the host cells to divert trafficking of Salmonella to the lysosomes. Finally, we have tested these hypothesis and shown that it is possible to divert Salmonella to the lysosomes for selective killing by modulating the content of endocytic GTPases in the host cells. Interestingly, we have also shown how Salmonella recruits Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein (LAMP1) by fusing with Golgi derieved LAMP1-containing vesicle through the interaction  of their effector molecule, SipC with host Syntaxin6. This is first evidence how an intracellular pathogen recruits LAMP without their targeting to the lysosomes.\n\nOur discovery of a new receptor system mediating uptake and intracellular degradation of hemoglobin by Leishmania suggests how, lacking heme biosynthetic ability, this parasite might meet the requirement of heme essential for its growth. Interestingly, further characterization of the receptor demonstrated that hemoglobin receptor in Leishmania is a suface localized hexokinase, a well characterized glycolytic enzyme. Recently, we have characterized the intercellular route of hemoglobin and their regulation in the parasites by different Rab GTPases by some elegant novel experiments. Our studies have revealed that signaling from the cytoplasmic tail of the hemoglobin receptor targets the hemoglobin to late degradative compartment suggesting that parasites has devised an unique procedure to target the internalized hemoglobin for degradation in late compartment to generate intracellular heme, essentially required by the parasites for growth. Discovery of this new receptor system  for acquiring heme by Leishmania is significant not only as a notable contribution to biology of this group of intracellular parasites but also as a potential new target against these parasites of paramount public health importance in the developing countries.\n\nSurvival of intracellular pathogens in the host cells depends on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that these cytokines possibly modulate distinct steps in the endocytic pathway and thereby regulate phagosome maturation. However, how cytokine modulate intracellular trafficking is not yet known. We have identified a novel mechanism of cytokine mediated modulation of the expression of Rab GTPase. We have shown that treatment of macrophages with IL-6 specifically induce the expression of Rab5 through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, whereas IL-12 exclusively unregulate the expression of Rab7 through the activation of p38 MAPK.  Finally, we have shown that IL-12 mediated overexpression of  Rab7 induces lysosomal transport whereas IL-6 stimulates the fusion between early compartments in macrophages and accordingly modulate trafficking and survival of intracellular pathogens in macrophages. This is the first demonstration showing that the existence of a unique regulation of membrane trafficking directly dependent on different cytokines.\nWe have also made seminal contributions to establish for the first time the feasibility of receptor-mediated enodocytosis as an alternative approach to deliver various drugs to macrophages using exquisite specificity and high efficiency process of scavenger receptor mediated endocytosis. We have shown that scavenger receptor-mediated intracellular delivery of various drugs to macrophages combat various infections as well as cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo .",

      "research_summary": "In the past we have addressed mechanistic aspects of peptide ligation reactions catalyzed by proteases. We have elaborated the concept of product-specific traps as a mechanism to facilitate reverse proteolytic condensation of polypeptide fragments. Furthermore, we have established volume exclusion effect, emanating from macromolecular crowding or confinement, as a driving force for reverse proteolysis.\nCurrent work in our laboratory is focused on elucidating the amide bond forming specificity of bacterial transpeptidase (referred to as sortases). Sortases are cysteine transpeptidases that anchor surface proteins to the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria. The archetypal sortase (SrtA) of Staphylococcus aureus recognizes a pentapeptide LPXTG motif present near the carboxy terminus of surface proteins, cleaves the T-G peptide bond and ligates the Protein-LPXT to the aminoglycine of the pentaglycine sequence present in peptidoglycan leading to anchoring of proteins to the cell wall.\nSrtA-mediated peptide ligation reaction also proceeds well with short LPXTG peptides and aminoglycine terminated sequences. The propensity of SrtA to recognize short consensus sequences has inspired the use of this enzyme as a versatile synthetic tool in protein chemistry and chemical biology. Several applications of SrtA including introduction of novel functionality (viz., fluorescent labels, lipids, GPI anchors etc) into proteins, generation of circular proteins and surface immobilization of proteins have emerged in the past 7-8 years.  Contemporaneously, we have been engaged in exploring the utility of SrtA in the synthesis of glycoconjugates, cyclic peptides, branched peptide oligomers and multivalent protein dendrimers that are not amenable to synthesis by purely chemical or genetic means.",

      "research_summary": "Gram positive Clostridium perfringens is a major cause of human and veterinary enteric disease largely because this bacterium can produce several toxins when present inside the gastrointestinal tract. Epsilon toxin, produced by Clostridium perfringens types B and D is the key antigen implicated in the Enterotoxaemia or Pulpy kidney disease of domestic animals. It is the third most lethal of all clostridial toxins. Epsilon toxin functions by interacting with the surface of mammalian cells probably through receptor binding and oligomerizes to form pores. Our initial focus is to identify the residues important for receptor binding as well as residues involved in oligomerization. We envisage to isolate the receptor for epsilon toxin to understand this interaction in greater detail. Further, by site-directed mutagenesis we aim to study the role of various residues within the gene for its toxicity and immunogenicity. Another emphasis of our research is to develop recombinant protein and DNA based vaccines against C. perfringens , C. novyi, C. chauvoei and D. nodosus.\n\nMy laboratory is also interested in Mycobacterium tuberculosis . More than 2.5 million deaths every year make tuberculosis one of the most lethal infectious diseases. Recent years have seen an increase in incidence of tuberculosis in both developing and industrialized countries, and there is an immediate need to search for new molecules that can be used as future drug target(s). In vivo growth studies of the organism have indicated that up to 70% of glucose metabolizes through the EMP pathway. Thus, glycolysis is central to the organism's survival and targeting the glycolytic enzymes, as potential drug targets to control M. tuberculosis may be feasible. My laboratory envisages cloning and expressing the genes of metabolic pathways beginning with the enzymes of EMP pathway. Subsequently genes encoding the enzymes of other metabolic pathways will be evaluated. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzymes will help in identifying the differences and similarities between the Mtb and human, which can be exploited for drug development. Further, production of large amounts of recombinant protein using efficient expression strategies would make it possible to carry out structural studies. This will help in defining the 3-dimensional structure of the enzymes ultimately leading to the rational development of new therapeutic interventions.\n\nSequencing of the complete genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv has revealed that approximately 8% of the total genome codes for members of two large families of conserved proteins, the PE and PPE families. The uniqueness of the genes of the PE and PPE families is that these are specifically present in mycobacteria and are mainly restricted to the pathogenic strain. Despite their numerical abundance and interesting distinctiveness, function of these genes remains largely unknown. A true understanding of the gene products  of a pathogen is essential for the successful control of disease. Functional characterization and defining the role of this unique family of proteins in mycobacterium biology may provide novel targets for chemotherapeutic intervention of tuberculosis.",

Investigation of crucial housekeeping proteins of\n   M. tuberculosis\n   for their role in survival and virulence of the pathogen. The functioning of caseinolytic protease (Clp) machinery, and RNase P mediated tRNA maturation is being investigated in\n   M. tuberculosis\n   .",
      "research_summary": "We been investigating the role of human ribonucleases, including human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR), EDN and ECP in host defense. HPR has a unique property of having a strong double stranded RNA cleavage activity. We have demonstrated that for the double stranded RNA cleavage activity of HPR glycine 38 is very important, and the basicity of the protein also plays a crucial role. In a very significant study we have shown that the interaction between HPR and ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) can be disrupted by mutating residues involved in HPR-RI binding. The inhibitor-resistant HPR mutants have been shown to manifest cytotoxic activity towards tumor cells. Further, using an inhibitor-resistant HPR mutant a recombinant dimeric HPR variant has been generated which shows specific cytotoxicity to tumor cells. The catalytic mechanism of eosinophil ribonuclease, EDN has also been delineated by our group to understand its role in eosinophil biology. We have also delineated the mechanism of antibacterial activity of ECP, and antiviral activity of EDN.\nTo understand the mechanism of action of a potent ribonucleolytic protein toxin, restrictocin from Aspergillus , we have identified a crucial histidine residue responsible for the target recognition, delineated the role of various cysteines and prolines in restrictocin catalysis, and also defined the functional boundaries in the toxin molecule. We have also solved the mechanism of specific target recognition and RNA hydrolysis by ribonucleolytic toxin restrictocin by an extensive mutational analysis and molecular modeling.\nAspergillus\nThe knowledge generated by the structure-function investigations was used to develop and engineer restrictocin based recombinant immunotoxins for targeted therapy of cancer. A strategy was developed to enhance the intracellular processing of restrictocin containing immunotoxins by incorporating a proteolytically cleavable spacer in these molecules. It is now possible to use ribonucleolytic toxin restrictocin to construct immunotoxins universally with any potential targeting ligand. We have also shown restrictocin to have anti-HIV activity which is dependent on its specific ribonucleolytic activity.\nSaporin, another protein toxin extensively studied in my laboratory, belongs to the family of ribosome-inactivating proteins that potently inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, by specifically depurinating rRNA, which results in cell death. We have demonstrated that saporin possesses two catalytic activities, namely RNA N-glycosidase and genomic DNA fragmentation activity, and for its complete cytotoxic activity both these activities are absolutely critical. We have further elucidated the mechanism of binding and internalization of saporin in eukaryotic cells. My group has identified crucial determinants for the potent cytotoxic activity of saporin, and also established its mechanism of apoptosis induction and anti-HIV activity.\nCaseinolytic proteases (Clps), members of the heat shock protein family, in many pathogenic bacteria have been shown to be involved in their virulence, survival in the host and dormancy. A similar mechanism may be operative in M. tuberculosis also and the members of the Clp protease family will be attractive drug targets. Our current studies are aimed at understanding the functioning of Clp protease machinery in M. tuberculosis by in vitro biochemical characterizations and by inactivating these proteins in vivo . As a first study in this field, our group has characterized M. tuberculosis ClpC1and established the role of N-terminal domain in its function. Also, we are investigating the regulation of heat shock proteins, particularly the role of transcriptional repressors, HspR and HrcA in M. tuberculosis . We have delineated the mechanism of repression by HspR of M. tuberculosis .\n\nWe have reconstituted the RNase P of M. tuberculosis in vitro , and delineated the role of a histidine in the RNR motif in its catalysis. Our studies show that the histidine in the RNR motif of M. tuberculosis is able to substitute optimally for asparagine found in the majority of the protein components of other bacterial RNase P enzymes. Further, we have analyzed the residues in RNase P protein of M. tuberculosis that differ from the residues generally conserved in other well-studied bacterial RNase Ps. We have demonstrated that Phe23, Val27 and Ala70 are involved in substrate binding, while Arg72 and Arg93 are involved in interactions with other residues within the protein to provide the protein a conformation conducive for activity.",

Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) Niche and Bone Marrow Regeneration\n   We investigate how the bone marrow niche regulates the engraftment and fate of exogenous HSCs. Our findings reveal that during marrow regeneration:\n\nDonor HSCs undergo transient amplification through symmetric divisions.\n\nDonor cells rescue host HSCs from apoptosis and promote proliferation by activating key cell cycle regulators.\n\nThis is followed by a return to quiescence, indicating that hematopoiesis is tightly governed by signals from the niche, particularly stromal cells.\n\nGene expression analyses (cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR) have shown that hematopoietic growth factors are robustly expressed during the early stages of regeneration. Several previously uncharacterized genes are also upregulated; their functional roles in hematopoiesis are currently under investigation.\n\nWe are also studying HSC aging, with preliminary data suggesting that both intrinsic cellular mechanisms and extrinsic niche-derived factors contribute to age-related hematopoietic decline.\n\n2.

Notably, Hemophilia A mice receiving uncommitted BM cell transplants showed long-term expression of active Factor VIII without inhibitor formation.\n\nCurrent work includes studying the genetic and epigenetic changes accompanying lineage reprogramming in BM-derived hepatic cells.\n\nTo overcome immune rejection in transplantation, we have shown that peripheral tolerance can be induced by co-transplantation with allo-reactive Treg cells, particularly effective in liver transplantation.\n\n3. Neuroregeneration Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells\n   In a parallel plasticity-focused project, we have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from fetal liver can differentiate into dopaminergic neuron-like cells. These cells:\n\nExhibit markers and functions comparable to dopamine-producing neurons\n\nImprove motor behavior in Parkinson’s disease (PD) mouse models upon transplantation\n\nOngoing studies aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms driving MSC differentiation into functional neurons.\n\n4. Hematopoietic Cells in Tumor Progression and Metastasis\n   We are also investigating the role of hematopoietic cells in cancer progression, focusing on ovarian and lung tumor models. Our research has identified:\n\nA specific subtype of hematopoietic lineage cells that frequently fuses with tumor cells\n\nThese fused cells exhibit enhanced migratory capacity and increased genetic instability, suggesting functional advantages in tumor dissemination\n\nWe hypothesize that cell fusion events contribute to tumor aggressiveness by transferring active hematopoietic factors to the tumor genome.",

      "research_summary": "Our research addresses key challenges in transgenesis, male infertility, and testicular cell biology, integrating advanced genetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approaches to develop innovative tools, improve reproductive health, and create genetically modified animals for biopharmaceutical applications.\n\n1. Development of a Non-lethal In Vivo Transgenesis Platform\n   Traditional transgenic techniques rely on the destruction of numerous fertilized oocytes, making them inefficient and ethically contentious. To overcome these limitations, we pioneered a death-less transgenesis technique involving in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA into dividing spermatogonial stem cells in the testis. This method enables rapid generation of transgenic offspring without sacrificing females, marking a paradigm shift in animal biotechnology:\n\nMice (Nature Methods, 2008; Scientific Reports, 2013)\n\nRats (Molecular Therapy: Nucleic Acids, 2016)\n\nThis approach is simple, reproducible, and adaptable across species. Current applications include the generation of transgenic farm animals to produce therapeutic proteins in milk, making them more cost-effective and accessible. To this end, we isolated and validated the buffalo β-casein promoter (Journal of Biotechnology, 2015), enabling tissue-specific expression of therapeutic genes in the mammary gland.\n\n2. Molecular Regulation of Male Fertility and Puberty Onset\n   Amidst rising rates of male infertility, our work has sought to elucidate molecular events associated with the onset of male fertility at puberty, focusing on Sertoli cells, the \"nurse cells\" essential for germ cell support and differentiation.\n\nKey contributions include:\n\nFunctional studies using monkey testicular Sertoli cells revealing pubertal molecular signatures (J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 2006)\n\nInsights into androgen and FSH signaling defects affecting Sertoli cell function (Human Reproduction, 2012; Am. J. Physiol., 2012; Endocrinology, 2015)\n\nIdentification of molecular cues underlying idiopathic infertility in men, with implications for diagnostic and therapeutic development\n\n3. Multi-Omics and Functional Genomics of Spermatogenesis\n   We employ a multi-omics approach to understand the genetic regulation of spermatogenic activation and arrest, integrating data from:\n\nTranscriptomics via microarray analysis and TRANSFAC-guided computational screening\n\nProteomics using SWATH-MS to identify differentially expressed proteins in active vs. inactive testes\n\nComparative genomics across mouse, rat, and monkey models\n\nThese analyses have led to the discovery of novel genes and regulatory factors, many of which are being functionally validated through transgenic rodent models.\n\n4. Functional Characterization of microRNAs in Spermatogenesis\n   To further refine our understanding of gene regulation, we investigated the role of microRNAs in testicular function:\n\nPerformed next-generation sequencing of microRNAs from spermatogenically active and inactive testes\n\nIdentified numerous differentially expressed miRNAs, some of which may regulate key stages of spermatogenesis\n\nFunctional validation is underway using overexpression systems and SPONGE-mediated sequestration in transgenic rodents to delineate the precise role of these miRNAs\n\nOur research integrates cutting-edge molecular techniques with a systems biology perspective, advancing the frontiers of reproductive genetics, non-invasive transgenesis, and biopharmaceutical production in animals.",

Type 1 Diabetes: Immunotherapy and Beta Cell Regeneration\n   T1D is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin dependence. Current insulin therapy manages symptoms but does not address the root autoimmune cause.\n\nWe are developing a dual therapeutic strategy:\n\nImmune modulation: Using nano/micro-particle encapsulated immunomodulatory peptides to attenuate autoreactive T cells and suppress autoimmunity.\n\nBeta cell regeneration: Utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from Balb/c mouse bone marrow to restore insulin production.\n\nKey initiatives:\n\nIn vivo testing of peptide-loaded biodegradable particles in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Balb/c and Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice\n\nDifferentiation of MSCs into insulin-producing cells using multiple protocols\n\nAssessing combined or independent efficacy of stem cell therapy and immune modulation\n\nThis approach aims to develop a curative strategy for T1D by targeting both immune dysfunction and beta cell loss.\n\n2. Vitiligo: Autoimmunity, Genetics, and Molecular Pathogenesis\n   Vitiligo is the most common pigmentation disorder, affecting 0.5–1% of the global population, caused by the selective destruction of melanocytes.\n\nOur research focuses on:\n\nImmunogenetic predisposition: We conducted the largest study on MHC associations in vitiligo, revealing key differences in peptide-binding residues of MHC class I and II between patients and controls. These differences influence the presentation of autoantigens.\n\nImmune dysregulation: Elevated levels of cytokines were observed in both lesional skin and peripheral blood, contributing to melanocyte loss.\n\nEpigenetic regulation: Genome-wide profiling identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) upregulated in lesional skin versus non-lesional skin of the same patients.\n\nCurrent work includes:\n\nFunctional studies on the impact of identified cytokines and miRNAs on primary melanocyte and keratinocyte cultures\n\nDissecting the molecular networks driving melanocyte destruction and melanin loss\n\nThis comprehensive approach seeks to unravel the complex immunogenetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying vitiligo and to identify potential therapeutic targets.",

      "research_summary": "Our laboratory is broadly engaged in understanding the structural and functional implications of protein glycosylation, a ubiquitous post-translational modification known to impact protein folding, stability, intracellular trafficking, and biological activity. While glycosylation can stabilize peptide conformation and restrict dynamic fluctuations, its structural microheterogeneity—resulting from diverse glycosylation patterns—often complicates the functional characterization of glycoproteins.\n\nTo address this, we utilize chemically synthesized homogeneous glycopeptides as rational model systems, enabling systematic studies of carbohydrate structures and their local perturbations. Our research focuses on elucidating the differential roles of carbohydrate domains in two key model systems:\n\n1. Antimicrobial Glycopeptides of Innate Immune Origin\n   Insects exhibit resistance to bacterial infections through the production of diverse proline-rich antimicrobial peptides such as drosocin, pyrrhocoricin, formaecins, diptericin, and lebocins. A distinctive feature of these peptides is the presence of O-glycosylated threonine residues, essential for their maximal antimicrobial activity. However, the precise functional role of the carbohydrate moiety remains poorly understood.\n\nOur studies aim to:\n\nInvestigate the structure–function relationship of these antimicrobial glycopeptides.\n\nDecipher the mechanism of action, hypothesized to involve bacterial cell entry and intracellular target binding.\n\nIdentify and characterize bacterial target proteins to further understand the bactericidal mechanism of these cationic glycopeptides.\n\n2. Novel Glycopeptide Inhibitors of Thrombin\n   Thrombin is a serine protease pivotal to the regulation of hemostasis, with additional roles in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, pregnancy, and several pathological conditions, including coagulation disorders, cancer, and bloodborne infections. Given its central role, thrombin has long been considered a promising therapeutic target.\n\nOur objective is to develop novel, fast-acting, specific, and potent glycopeptide inhibitors of thrombin. To this end:\n\nWe design and synthesize customized glycopeptide inhibitors.\n\nConduct structure–function studies to optimize their activity and specificity.\n\nExplore the potential of these inhibitors in addressing thrombin-associated pathologies.\n\nBy integrating synthetic chemistry, structural biology, and functional immunology, our research seeks to provide mechanistic insights into glycopeptide function and develop novel therapeutic candidates targeting both infectious diseases and thrombin-mediated disorders.",

      "research_summary": "Summary of Research\nWe engaged in the development and evaluation of novel immunotherapeutic and chemo-immunotherapeutic strategies against tuberculosis and cancer, with a special focus on the immunomodulatory potential of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP).\n\n1. Protective Efficacy of MIP in Tuberculosis\n   M. indicus pranii (MIP), a non-pathogenic mycobacterial strain sharing cross-reactive antigens with M. tuberculosis, is being investigated as an alternative vaccine candidate to M. bovis BCG. Earlier studies demonstrated that killed MIP can confer protection against M. tuberculosis infection.\n\nOur current research focuses on:\n\nEvaluating the protective efficacy of MIP in both live and killed forms\n\nComparing parenteral and aerosol routes of immunization\n\nAssessing immune responses elicited by MIP and comparing them to those generated by BCG vaccination\n\nUtilizing various animal models of tuberculosis, including mice and guinea pigs\n\nWe also explore MIP as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce treatment duration in both sub-acute and chronic stages of tuberculosis.\n\n2. Immunotherapy and Chemo-immunotherapy in Cancer\n   The role of the immune system in cancer control is well established. However, tumors often develop mechanisms to suppress host immunity within the local microenvironment. Our goal is to reactivate anti-tumor immunity using immunomodulators such as MIP and to combine them with standard chemotherapy to achieve a synergistic effect.\n\nMIP as an Immunotherapeutic Agent\nBuilding on our findings in tuberculosis, where MIP induces strong Th1-type immune responses, we investigated MIP’s anti-tumor activity in murine tumor models. Studies include:\n\nEvaluating MIP as a standalone immunomodulatory agent\n\nAssessing MIP in combination with commercial chemotherapeutic agents\n\nInvestigating mechanisms of MIP-mediated immune activation, including Th1 polarization and macrophage stimulation\n\nDevelopment of Chemo-immunotherapeutic Formulations\nWe designed novel formulations that combine the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy with the immune-activating potential of immunostimulants. Our strategy includes:\n\nConjugating Paclitaxel (PTX) with SP-LPS, a non-toxic derivative of LPS, to create a dual-function molecule\n\nFormulating nanoparticles co-encapsulating PTX and SP-LPS\n\nEvaluating their anticancer activity in preclinical models\n\nFuture directions involve:\n\nExploring alternative polymers with macrophage-stimulating and anti-tumor properties\n\nOptimizing formulation parameters for enhanced tumor microenvironment modulation and immune priming\n\nThrough these integrated efforts, we aim to develop innovative vaccine and immunotherapy platforms that not only enhance host immunity against tuberculosis and cancer but also improve therapeutic outcomes through synergistic chemo-immunotherapy.",

      "research_interest": "Cell death is one of the fundamental biological processes required to maintain normal development. A cell’s decision to live or die is tightly regulated by signals originating from various sources. Our interest is to elucidate the regulatory processes of cell death and the associated mechanisms.",
      "research_summary": "The course of evolution has shaped different species for their survival during conditions of stress, natural development, differentiation and growth. These conditions represent the two faces of the same coin because continued growth or continuous stress would hamper survival. To circumvent these problems, all animal cells have evolved the capability to kill themselves by turning on gene-encoded cell suicide programs. These programs not only help the organisms to survive in conditions of excessive stress but also help prevent abnormal growth. The decision of whether a particular cell will live or die is tightly regulated by many different signals originating both from within the cell and from its environment. The implementation of this self-destruction program leads to a morphologically distinct form of cell death termed apoptosis and deregulation of apoptosis is associated with a variety of diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. There are considerable variations in which apoptosis occur in different systems and under different conditions. Cell death also occurs via processes such as programmed necrosis and autophagy and it is the balance between survival and these death processes that determines the fate of a cell. The major focus of the laboratory is to elucidate the precise mechanisms of cell death and how this process is regulated by the diverse signalling pathways using unicellular ( Leishmania parasite) and multicellular (cancer cells) model systems with or without genetic manipulations. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of cell death events that can help in the development of improved therapeutics for diseases associated with anomalous cell death.",
