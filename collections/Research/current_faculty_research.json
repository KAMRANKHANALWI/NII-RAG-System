      "research_summary": "Projects: Structure-function relationship studies on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FAS) has been regarded as an important drug target against several tropical diseases, owing to the remarkable structural and functional differences between their proteins and the host. Most microorganisms synthesize fatty acids via a type II pathway, while their human counterpart synthesizes using the type I pathway. In the type II pathway, fatty acids are synthesized by multiple enzymes catalyzing different reactions, whereas in type I pathway, fatty acids are synthesized by one single multidomain, multifunctional fatty acid synthase, each domain catalyzing a particular reaction. Interestingly, ACP’s of type I and II pathway share a similar fold, though differ remarkably in their mechanism of function. The primary function of ACP is to shuttle the lengthening acyl chains to the catalytic site of the FAS enzymes. It is expressed as an apo protein (inactive), and modified to holo-ACP (active) by the transfer of a 4’-phosphopantetheine moiety (4’-PP) from coenzyme A (CoA) to a conserved serine residue, Ser 36/37, ACP synthase acting as a catalyst. The acyl chain gets covalently tethered to the terminal cysteamine thiol of the 4’-PP prosthetic group, which in turn transfers the acyl chain to the respective enzymes during elongation. The acyl carrier protein functions in a very different way in the type II pathway, and type I. Structural studies have shown that the hydrophobic cavity accommodates the growing acyl chain in the type II pathway, which expands with increasing length of the acyl chain, while the type I ACP does not. However, a few questions still remain unanswered viz. how are the acyl intermediates recognized by their enzymes. Moreover, in type I fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, the mechanism of protection of the acyl chain by ACP still remains elusive. Yeast, also belongs to the type I pathway, but its ACP can partially sequester the acyl chain, by a mechanism that remains elusive. To address these, and several other questions, we are trying to understand the structure and interactions of some key proteins of this pathway from E. coli, P. falciparum, Leishmania, yeast and human using NMR. We hope, that understanding the structural features that dictate ACP function and its interaction with other enzymes, could offer new avenues for inhibitor design.\nProjects:\n\nIn Leishmania, and other eukaryotes, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondria. Apart from synthesizing fatty acids, an important role of this pathway is to supply precursors for lipoic acid and biotin synthesis. Lipoic acid deficiency is associated with a myriad of disorders in human's, underscoring the need to understand the pathway at the molecular level. Thus, another major interest of the lab is to understand the structure and function of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of lipoic acids, and posttranslational modification of acceptor proteins in Leishmania, E. coli and human.",

      "research_summary": "According to global cancer statistics 2020, the global cancer burden is expected to rise 47% from 2020 to 2040. Due to changing socio-economic scenario and sedentary lifestyle, the Indian cancer burden is also on the rise, therefore an urgent research investment in the cancer field is the need for better-personalized drug development. Tumorigenesis is an evolving multistep process involving genetic and epigenetic changes that provide a growth advantage to cancer cells over normal cells. The next-generation genome sequencing of cancer cells has identified new recurrent mutations, but the exact biological effects of those mutations are unknown. Our laboratory primarily applies biochemistry, molecular cell biology, genetic and epigenetic approaches to study such mutations in proteins and DNA-protein complexes. Nucleosome remodelers, chromatin modifiers(writers, erasers), and readers of histone and DNA modifications are frequently altered in cancer. However, the oncogenic nature and mechanisms of histone mutations itself in cancer are not clear. Histones are not only the packaging material of eukaryotic DNA but also control the dynamic nature of chromatin, essential for replication, transcription, and DNA repair. We are applying the diverse techniques to study the following topics:\n\n1. The role of “Readers” and “Erasers” proteins in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway We are focusing on demethylases and bromodomain proteins, to identify novel synthetic lethal genetic interactions of “readers/writers “protein with DDR pathway genes.\n1. The role of “Readers” and “Erasers” proteins in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway\n\n2.  Understanding the oncogenic and biological effect of cancer-associated histone H3 and H4 mutations Very high-frequency somatic heterozygous missense mutations in histone H3 genes at highly conserved amino terminus residues (K27, K36 and G34) were reported in pediatric high-grade gliomas, sarcomas, head-neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas as well as many adult cancers. H3.3K27M oncohistone reduces repressive histone modification marks, H3K27 trimethylation in trans by altering activities of polycomb repressive complex 2, thus interfering with the developmentally regulated genes whereas H3.3G34R mutation reduces activating mark, H3K36me3 in cis . These mechanisms suggest alteration in gene expression pattern and may contribute toward tumorigenesis. On the other hand, few studies argue that tumorigenesis may likely occur due to genomic instability caused by H3.3K27M and H3.3G34R oncohistones. How differential PTMs of H3K36 and H3K27 may impact genome stability is not clear. Also, the common mechanism of oncohistone mutants (H3.3K27M and H3.3G34R) toward genome instability is elusive.\n2.  Understanding the oncogenic and biological effect of cancer-associated histone H3 and H4 mutations\n\nin trans\nin cis\n3.  Identifying functions of histone demethylases to enhance the antitumor potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell CAR T cell therapy is successful in hematological cancers but its potential for solid tumors needs further extensive research. Therefore, our lab has a growing interest in combination therapy to improve tumor resistance against CAR T cells.\n3.  Identifying functions of histone demethylases to enhance the antitumor potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell",

      "research_summary": "In the mammalian host, invasion of the hepatocytes is the first step towards developing malaria disease. Invasion by infective sporozoites is complex process and not understood very well. How parasite interacts with its host is the focus of my current research. We discovered that during early liver stage development a sporozoite surface protein (CSP) is introduced in the hepatocytes cytoplasm. CSP then shuttles into and out of nucleus of hepatocytes and changes the host transcription profile. CSP export into the cytoplasm of infected hepatocyte requires the presence of PEXEL / HTS motifs. The transport of CSP into the hepatocyte nucleus is then mediated by importins α3/β1 that binds to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of CSP. The NLSs of CSP and NFκB p50 share the same importins. The entry of NFκB-p50 into the nucleus is strongly inhibited in cell lines expressing CSP, and in infected hepatocytes. Microarray data, from a N-terminal truncated CSP expressing cell line, showed that 40 NFκB targets were significantly down regulated. Presence of CSP in the host modifies thousands of host gene transcription that govern diverse biological processes such as metabolite transport, cell cycle, immune responses, cell growth, cell attachment, apoptosis and hypoxia and the overall effect is to enhance EEF growth.\nWe have the following two major areas of interest:\n\n1. Understanding Host-parasite interactions during malaria liver stages development. Our focus is to identify Plasmodium proteins that modulate the hepatocyte cellular functions. Knockout of parasite genes combined with analyses of global changes (using omics techniques) in the infected host cell is used for the purpose.\n   Understanding Host-parasite interactions during malaria liver stages development.\n2. Antigen/Drug discovery. We focus on\n   Antigen/Drug discovery.\n   A] Knowledge based target identification for inhibitor design. B] Known and novel compounds assay (ex vivo and in vivo) to test inhibitor/ drug efficacy. C] Discovery of new antigens from liver-stage parasites and evaluation in animal models.\n\nA multi-disciplinary approach is used to address above issues.",

      "research_summary": "There are increasing research reports which establish the link between human microbiota and carcinogenesis. Pathogenic bacteria and altered microbiota interact with mucosal surface and as a result, epithelial damage can be seen especially in chronic infection conditions. It can be reckoned that gut microbiota-derived metabolites play key role in epithelial damage and carcinogenesis. Recent intriguing data is hinting at a much broader link between microbiota, bacterial infections, inflammation and carcinogenesis. The mechanism of this relationship between bacteria and human cancer is not well studied and understood, hence our laboratory aim to delineate this complex interaction among microbiota, bacterial infections, inflammation and carcinogenesis. We are also exploring the role of bacteria, microbiota and their metabolites in enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Current Projects 1. Towards understanding the link between intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer The gut microbiota is considered as a forgotten organ in human health and disease. It maintains gut homeostasis by various complex mechanisms.The dysbiosis or disruption of gut flora has been confirmed to be related to gastrointestinal diseases such as CRC and other diseases in different organs. Colorectal cancer is a multi-factorial and multi-stage involved disorder. The role of microorganisms that initiate and facilitate the process of colorectal cancer has become clear. Our group is studying the link of gut microbes in colorectal cancer causation. Clearly, more information is needed about the mechanisms through which the microbial community promotes carcinogenesis. Understanding the events leading to the development of intestinal carcinogenesis through gut microbes will provide novel insight into this pathology, and potentially lead to new therapeutic modalities targeting the microbiota. 2. Role of oral microbiota in colorectal cancer progression and Carcinogenesis Recent reports indicate that the oral microbiome can colonize the gut, leading to dysregulation of the gut microbes. Furthermore, the oral-gut microbes create an intestinal inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. Our group is identifying oral bacteria and their metabolites which may be implicated for their genotoxic and carcinogenic role leading to colorectal cancer progression and carcinogenesis. This project is also aimed at studying oral to intestinal microbial transmission and the inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment, induced by oral-gut axis microbes in the gut.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nTowards understanding the link between intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer\n\nRole of oral microbiota in colorectal cancer progression and Carcinogenesis\n\n3.

We are mainly interested in those enzymes/receptors that are important targets for the design of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents etc. The functional studies along with the structural data may provide to design inhibitors/drug candidates for therapeutic purposes. We are using a combination of molecular biology, biochemical, kinetic, thermodynamic and structural approaches such as rapid transient kinetics, mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, fluorescence, isothermal calorimeter and x-ray crystallography to address these problems.\nInterferons induced GTPases Interferons (IFN) are immunomodulatory cytokines that mediate anti-pathogenic and anti-proliferative effects in cells. The guanylate-binding proteins, known as GTPases are among the most abundant proteins induced by IFN-gamma. They constitute two families of GTP binding proteins with molecular masses 47 and 65-67 kDa, respectively. The p47 GTP binding proteins have been indentified in mammals but the p67 GBPs (hGBP1, hGBP2 etc) have been found in all vertebrates including human, mouse etc. In contrast to all other GTPases, which hydrolyze GTP to GDP, hGBP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to a mixture of GMP and GDP, with GMP being the major product. It has been found that this protein blocks the replication of vesicular stomatitis, encephalomyocarditis viruses in HeLa cells and more recently influenza, whereas the mechanism leading to this effect is unknown and it also antagonizes the proliferation and angiogenic activity of endothelial cells on inflammation. However, the antiviral activity is much weaker than human MxA, another group of proteins within the super family of dynamin related large GTPase, which are induced by interferon-alpha. The p47 GTPases act as antimicrobials in cells; they appear to suppress Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium spp . The structure-functional relationship is important in view of understanding how these proteins work at the molecular level. We recently identified an alpha helix of the intermediate domain which acts as an internal GAP (GTPase activating protein) in hGBP1 ( J. Mol.

Misregulation of the dynamic nuclear and chromatin organization is associated with various developmental disorders, cancers and other diseases. Various aspects underlying this intriguing organization, relevant for regulation of transcription and VDJ recombination in lymphocytes, are being deciphered by chromosome conformation capture analyses and other biochemical assays as well as direct visualization of developmentally regulated loci within the nucleus in wild type and genetically manipulated mouse mutants.\nKeywords : Genome architecture and dynamics, Chromatin organization, VDJ recombination, Epigenetics, Mammalian gene regulation",
      "research_summary": "Role of enhancers in genome organization and function: Enhancers are the vanguards of tissue specific gene regulation but the mechanisms underlying their ability to activate specific cognate promoters are diverse and not completely understood. Our recent studies have demonstrated an unambiguous role of enhancer Eb in defining TCRb location relative to chromosome territory. The ability to reposition the target locus relative to chromosome territory highlights a novel aspect pertaining to activity of enhancers which may contribute to their ability to regulate gene expression and adds to the diversity of mechanisms underlying enhancer activity. Further, enhancers are well known as critical regulators of chromatin accessibility. Our observations support the idea that enhancers also influence intranuclear movements of loci relative to chromosome territory. This has implications for understanding the role of enhancers in three-dimensional genome organization and function and provides a useful start point to gain insights in understanding how intranuclear positions of genes change during development.\nRole of CTCF in chromatin organization : CTCF, a DNA binding protein with multifunctional attributes, is an important contributor to chromatin organization. Global analysis by ChIP-Seq and ChIA-PET has demonstrated the presence of several thousand CTCF binding sites in the human and mouse genomes and emphasized their importance in defining chromatin looping patterns critical for specific regulation of genes.  Understanding about the role and mechanisms of CTCF based higher order chromatin organization has emerged based on quest to understand transcriptional regulation. In addition, higher order chromatin organization is also critically important for VDJ recombination at antigen receptor loci (Igh, Igk, TCRa/d and TCRb) in developing B-cells and T-cells and each of these loci have several CTCF binding sites. Considering the diverse and multifunctional attributes of CTCF, current efforts in the lab focus on understanding different aspects underlying CTCF based regulation of transcription and VDJ recombination. Our chromosome conformation capture analysis indicated that CTCF plays an important role in VDJ recombination at TCRb locus. It mediates long-range chromatin looping interactions important for establishment of recombination center as well as facilitates the spatial proximity of TCRb variable gene segments to the recombination center. Our analysis also suggests that even mild changes in the CTCF-based chromatin organization, that may arise due to mutations or epigenetic aberrations, can have profound functional consequences for gene expression.",

We majorly focus on designing anti-TB molecules primarily through a target-based approach.",
      "research_summary": "Bacteria, plants, and fungi have special enzymes to make an important amino acid called histidine (His). But humans can’t produce it on their own because they lack the necessary enzymes. The bacteria that causes tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mtb) makes histidine in 10 steps using 11 enzymes.\n\nEarlier studies — including some from our own lab — showed that knocking out just one enzyme in this histidine pathway can make Mtb much less harmful. Since histidine is essential for making proteins, blocking this pathway could be a smart strategy for developing new anti-TB drugs. To support this idea, we studied the 3D structures of key enzymes involved in this pathway. This helps us understand how these enzymes work and design targeted inhibitors using structure-based methods.\n\n- Structural Studies of HisB and HisC Enzymes\n  In recent years, our team has successfully determined high-resolution 3D structures of two important enzymes:\n\nHisB (imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase)\n\nHisC (histidinol phosphate aminotransferase)\n\nThese enzymes help convert specific molecules in the histidine pathway. For example, HisB converts imidazole glycerol phosphate into imidazole acetol phosphate (IAP). HisB has 210 amino acids and forms a symmetrical structure made of 24 identical units, each with catalytic activity. Its structure looks very similar to that seen in other organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana, Filobasidiella neoformans, and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n- HisC Structure and New Drug Design\n  HisC handles the 7th step of the pathway: converting IAP into L-histidinol phosphate. Like other enzymes that use PLP (pyridoxal phosphate) as a cofactor, HisC has two domains:\n\nA larger PLP-binding domain with a specific folding pattern (α/β/α)\n\nA smaller C-terminal domain\n\nIts overall shape resembles a left hand, with structural regions named palm, thumb, and fingers. The PLP-binding area is the core of the enzyme and includes a seven-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six alpha helices. The thumb, made of three helices, links the other parts together and helps close over the PLP-binding site.\n\nUsing these detailed structures, we worked with chemists and biologists to design a set of triazole-based inhibitors that can block HisB. These compounds show very strong activity (sub-micromolar levels) in lab tests, and we are now testing their effectiveness in live models.\n\n- Exploring Membrane Proteases in TB\n  The Mtb genome contains about 12 membrane proteases (MPs). These are critical for the bacteria’s survival and virulence, especially when facing host immune cells like macrophages. However, we still don’t fully understand their substrates, exact membrane location, or function.\n\nTo explore this, we’ve taken a biochemical, biophysical, and immunological approach. We’ve successfully produced and purified three membrane proteases (Rv2223c, Rv2224c, and Rv2672) using a special bacterial system (Mycobacterium smegmatis) to get pure and uniform protein samples.\n\nMost recently, we’ve discovered that Rv2672 plays a role in breaking down host lipids, revealing another angle of how Mtb survives in human cells.",

      "research_summary": "Title: Determining the signalling and repair pathways that are altered during genomic instability in nucleus and mitochondria\n\nTheme of Research:\n\nA. Development of therapeutics against colon cancer detection: Colon cancer is one of the most common type of cancer in India. A major issue for colon cancer treatment is the recurrence. Recurrence occur due to the development of chemoresistance to the drugs used to treat the primary colon cancer. Using a unbiased screening procedure and multiple mice models we have identified three small molecules (which are FDA) we have identified three molecules which can act to prevent chemoresistance and allow the chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin, camptothecin and oxaliplatin to optimally function (Kaur et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2024). Efforts are being made to use these small molecules for adjunct therapy in cancer treatments.\nA. Development of therapeutics against colon cancer detection:\n\nThere is a unmet need of colon cancerdetection methods, especially in the early stages. We discovered six microRNAs (which were named DNA damage sensitive microRNAs or DDSMs) which were upregulated only in colon cancer cells. Analysis done with more than 410 patient information in TCGA and the biopsy materials of 54 patients from AIIMS, New Delhi indicated found that the DDSMs were all upregulated even in Stage I coloncancer tissues and not in the surrounding normal tissues(Priya et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2021). This microRNA based signature is being taken forward as a potential biomarker for coloncancer detection.\nB. Determine how tumor suppressors recognize the damaged DNA: Human cells are exposed to multitude of DNA damage every day. Our work has tried to understand how DNA damage was recognized by the cells so that it could be repaired by either of the two main repair pathways – homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. We showed that cells have overlapping yet distinct processes to recognize different types of DNA damages. Ubiquitylation of tumour suppressor BLM by chromatin associated E3 ligases, interactions with process specific proteinsand a biphasic mode of recruitment to the site of damage which was dependent on cell cycle – were some of the key determinants of this process (Tikoo et al., The EMBO Journal, 2013; Tripathi et al., Nature Communications, 2018).\nB. Determine how tumor suppressors recognize the damaged DNA:\n\nC. Understanding the role of tumor suppressors in the repair of damaged DNA: Our work had provided evidence that a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between several key proteins involved in the repair pathway allows cells to repair the damaged DNA by homologous recombination (Tripathi et al., Journal of Cell Biology, 2007; Carcinogenesis, 2008; Kaur et al, Molecular Cancer Research, 2010). Subsequently we have provided evidence how the chromatinorganization is acted upon by chromatin remodelers in cells to allow better accessibility of the factors which would repair the damaged genome (Srivastava et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2009).\nC. Understanding the role of tumor suppressors in the repair of damaged DNA:\n\nD. Dissecting the role of protein turnover during cancer development: We have tried to understand the inter-regulation between the tumour suppressors and the E3 ligases during cancer development. We have demonstrated how a well-known E3 ligase in colon cancer development, called Fbw7 a , is allowed to optimally recognize its oncogenic substrates like the oncoproteins c-Myc and c-Jun (Chandra et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2012; Priyadarshini et al., Cell Reports, 2018). Further also determined the mechanism degradation of two tumour suppressors by Fbw7 a , thereby allowing the potential development of a non-degradable versions which can resistturnover and thereby be active for a longer duration (Kharat et al., Oncogene, 2016; Tripathi et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2019).\nD. Dissecting the role of protein turnover during cancer development:\n\nE. Identifying and characterizing the functions of a new mitochondrial helicase: Apart from the nucleus, mitochondria have its own genetic material. We identified a new mitochondrial helicase, RECQL4. We identified how this helicase goes to the mitochondria, interacts with different mitochondrial proteins and affects the mitochondrial replication process (De et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2012). Further we provided mechanistic evidence how RECQL4 enhanced the functions of the sole mitochondrial polymerase, Pol g A (Gupta et al., Carcinogenesis, 2014). Lack of such a functional interaction led to more accumulation of DNA damage in mitochondrial DNA which contributed to the initiation of cancer (Kumari et al., Journal of Cell Science, 2016).\nE.

Understanding the mechanism of the entry of proteins into mitochondria: For long time mitochondrial protein entry was thought to be dependent only on the presence or absence of mitochondrial localization signal (MLS). We recently provided evidence that apart from MLS, there existed another mechanism for mitochondrial entry. Ubiquitylation of two proteins involved in mitochondrial replication, Pol g A and RECQL4, by a specific E3 ligase(called MITOL) on the outer surface of the organelle prevented their entry. This post-translational modification which allowed only the non-ubiquitylated PolA  and RECQL4 to enter the organelle. We demonstrated this phenomenon contributed to the mitochondrial disorders, namely autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) and Rothmund Thomson Syndrome (RTS).Manipulation of the ubiquitylation status of Pol g A and RECQL4 mutants reverted the process allowing the functional reactivation of these proteins (Hussain et al., PLoS Biology, 2021).\nF.

      "research_summary": "Research Interest in Bone Biology\n\nThe skeleton is an organ that undergoes continuous modeling and remodeling to sustain structural integrity and subserve its many roles in the body. Both bone modeling and remodeling are intricate processes influenced by diet, intrinsic hormonal milieu , metabolism, physical stimulus and genetic factors. One of the main interests of my laboratory relates to a condition called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) caused by increased dietary intake of methionine, deficiency of vitamins like folic acid and vitamin B 12 or genetic deficiency in enzymes like cystathionine β-synthase of methionine metabolism pathway. HHCY received increased attention in skeletal biology after its identification as a player between bone mineral density and post-menopause. In Molecular Sciences Laboratory, we use our expertise in bone cell biology to understand the etiology of skeletal conditions during HHCY.\n\nMy laboratory is interested in studying the regulatory mechanisms governing altered osteoblast and osteocyte behaviour during HHCY, with focus on identification of transcription factors that control cellular differentiation and adaptation in response to HHCY. By performing siRNA knockdown experiments in osteoblasts in vitro, we have identified FOXO1, a redox regulator to have a crucial role in the synthesis of osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor that blocks untoward osteoclast activation. By similar molecular approach we were able to identify the role of MyD88, an adapter protein in toll like receptor-4 signaling in the expression of TRAP5b expression in developing osteoclasts. Both FOXO1 and MyD88 are proteins that have been found to be regulated by homocysteine and methionine respectively.\nWe are currently using a variety of approaches to define underlying molecular mechanisms by which homocysteine governs osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis and understand the determinants involved therein employing molecular and pharmacological approaches.\nOur long term goal is not only to understand molecular basis of bone loss during HHCY, but also to provide insight into the pathogenesis of a predominant clinical conditions that affect women in later years – post-menopausal osteoporosis . Post menopausal osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures. We focus on novel interventional strategies that can open a new vista for therapeutics against post menopausal osteoporosis.\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders: Protein misfolding, misassembly, and extracellular deposition are related to a class of diseases collectively known as “conformational diseases”, which include Alzheimer’s disease, prion disease, dialysis-related amyloidosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and type II diabetes etc. Most of these diseases are incurable and fatal. The proteins and peptides related to these diseases can self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies with a common cross-ß structure. The human health impact of these diseases has motivated intensive study of the structure and growth of amyloid fibrils. A mechanistic understanding of the amyloid-assembly process will provide new holds and probes for the physiological interactions that cause amyloidosis. This will allow better approaches to the prevention of amyloid formation and new diagnostics for early detection of amyloid-related diseases. Our lab is involve in identifying the important modifications in the protein sequence that leads to change in its folding and interactions with other protein and ultimately leads to its misfolding and aggregation in to amyloid fibril. These studies may help understanding the intracellular events that leads to cell death on extracellular deposition of protein fibril or intermediates of fibril formation which in turn helps in designing specific therapeutic agents targeting different steps of disease progression for the effective treatment of the disease.We also hypothesis that blocking and/or reversing amyloid formation will be an effective treatment for diseases involving organ failure due to amyloidosis. This requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of amyloid growth and the factors that influence the (dis)aggregation rates at all stages of amyloid assembly. We have chosen three diseases: Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and transthyretin-related amyloidosis to address these issues. We also work on to understand the mechanisms and factors that modulate the activity, structure and expression of glutamate transporters and endoplasmic reticulum associated proteins in neurological diseases.",

T Cell Memory Development in Infectious Diseases\n   The formation of immunological memory is a key feature of protective immunity and underpins the success of vaccination. During a primary infection, naive T cells differentiate into memory T cells with specialized immune defense capabilities against future reinfections by the same pathogen.\n\nOur lab focuses on:\n\nUnderstanding how T cell memory forms during the first infection\n\nInvestigating how this memory is maintained over time to protect against secondary infections\n\nWe study pathogen-specific memory subsets, such as:\n\nCD4⁺ cytotoxic memory T cells in viral infections (e.g., Dengue virus, Cytomegalovirus, EBV, Influenza)\n\nCD4⁺ T helper memory subsets in bacterial infections, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nOur broader objective is to uncover the biological mechanisms of these specialized memory T cell subsets and translate this knowledge into strategies for enhancing long-lasting immune responses through therapeutics and vaccination.\n\n2. Immune Response to Neonatal Sepsis\n   Neonatal sepsis remains a major clinical challenge with limited understanding of the host immune response due to constraints like small sample volumes. Traditional whole blood analyses are often skewed by the dominance of specific immune cell types, making it difficult to gain cell-type-specific insights.\n\nIn this project, we aim to:\n\nTrack dynamic changes in immune cell proportions during sepsis\n\nAnalyze associated gene expression patterns specific to individual immune cell types\n\nBy using transcriptomic and cellular profiling, our goal is to build a more accurate picture of the immune system's behavior in neonatal sepsis, which can lead to better diagnostics and targeted interventions for this vulnerable population.",

To do this, we have established longitudinal cohorts of controlled vaccination and virus infection. Besides, we are also using ex vivo T fh model and mouse models to mechanistically investigate the leads generated from our human studies. (ii) Human virus infection .

      "research_summary": "Cell-signaling is a consortium of cellular events wherein the transmission of environmental signals to cells sets off a cascade of reactions that ultimately culminate in changes in gene expression and activity.  One of the major mechanisms through which cell signaling pathways operate is the reversible phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) in Mtb regulate a number of cellular processes including cell division. There are 11 eukaryotic-like STPKs in Mtb , and our lab has been working on analyzing the functional roles of the phosphorylation events mediated by these kinases.\n\nProtein kinases A and B are essential genes that play a role in modulating cell shape, and possibly cell division. Overexpressing of PknA in M. tuberculosis results in a deviation from normal cell morphology with the cells forming an elongated and branched structure, while overexpression of PknB in M. tuberculosis results in the formation of widened and bulging cells. The Mtb protein kinase B (PknB) comprises an intracellular kinase domain, connected through a transmembrane domain to an extracellular region that contains four PASTA domains. We performed comprehensive analysis of different domains of PknB in the context of viability in avirulent and virulent mycobacteria and showed that although the presence of the C-terminal PASTA domain is dispensable in the avirulent M. smegmatis, all four PASTA domains are essential in Mtb .  Work from the lab showed that the stringent regulation of PknB expression is necessary for cell survival, with depletion or overexpression of PknB leading to cell death. Recently we showed that Protein kinase A is essential for in vitro growth as well as for the survival of the pathogen in the host. Although PknA and PknB are expressed as part of the same operon, they appear to be regulating cellular processes through divergent signaling pathways.\n\nProtein kinase G (PknG) has been shown to play a role in the survival of the pathogen in host macrophages by modulating phagosome-lysosome fusion (lysosomal transfer) after macrophages phagocytose mycobacterium, and PknG kinase activity is essential for mediating its effect on lysosomal transfer. We have investigated the role of PknG and PknG mutants in the pathogenesis of mycobacteria in mice, and showed for the first time that the expression of PknG in non-pathogenic mycobacteria allows the continued existence of these bacteria in host tissues. We were the first to characterize PknK and show that PknK modulates the activation of transcription from the promoter of mycobacterial monooxygenase operon, through phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator VirS.\nThe identification and characterization of target substrates for kinases is extremely important to decipher the function of the pathway within the cell. We have identified enzymes N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) to be novel substrates of PknA as well as PknB and demonstrated   that   while   PknB   mediated   phosphorylation   of   GlmU   does   not   affect  its uridyltransferase activity, it significantly modulates the protein’s acetyltransferase activity. In collaboration with Dr. Balaji Prakash, we determined the structure of GlmU Mtb in complex with substrates bound at the acetyltransferase active site, and uncovered unique features in the carboxy terminus of GlmU Mtb . Recently we have comprehensively dissected the role of GlmU Mtb in arbitrating the survival of pathogen both in vitro and in vivo . In collaboration with Dr. D. Sriram, we developed a novel oxazolidine derivative targeting the uridyltransferase allosteric site, which specifically inhibited GlmU Mtb in vitro and ex vivo. Work from our lab showed that phosphorylation of InhA, the primary target of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid and a key enzyme of the Fatty Acid Synthase-II system involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mtb , impacts mycobacterial growth and survival.\n\nThough all the Mtb STPKs have been biochemically characterized and a number of substrates identified, many questions remain to be answered. The role of the extracellular environment on activation/inactivation of kinases has not yet been investigated. Despite the fact that many of the substrates were initially identified to be substrates for one specific kinase or other, most are actually phosphorylated by multiple STPKs. Thus, a key feature amongst all these kinase-substrate interactions is the redundancy of signalling, suggesting a complicated temporal and spatial control over key mycobacterial processes. It is conceivable that many or all of the signalling molecules described here may in fact regulate each other, similar to the cross-talk seen in most eukaryotic signalling pathways.  Our ultimate aim to decipher the signaling pathways in Mtb and determine how these signaling molecules influence the survival in the host upon infection.",

The field of nanotechnology allied chemistry provides the tools for designing a diversified array of nanoparticles based on their sizes, shapes, engineered surface, chemical composition, and, most importantly, the nano-specific property. Harvesting the potential of nanotechnology to induce sustainable anti-tumor immune response is one of the prime interests of our research. Currently, monoclonal antibodies such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4), programmed cell death protein 1(PD1), and/or PD1-ligand (PD1-L) therapy to block the immune checkpoint inhibitors is the promising and successful immunotherapy for cancer. In earlier research, we developed autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex (p-MHC) coated nanoparticle to blunt autoimmune responses without compromising systemic immunity. This nanomedicine modulates the regulatory immune network by converting and expanding disease-specific T-regulatory type-1(T-reg) cells to prevent autoimmune diseases. Inspired by these scientific advancements, we are interested in developing the nanotherapeutic platform based on designing of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) displaying and/or carrying optimized immune stimulatory molecules and empowering professional APCs by delivering stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist to present tumor-associated antigen (TAA). Additionally, using the nanotechnology platform, we will modulate the activity of the chaperone network of tumor cells to elicit tumor-specific effector T-cell response. We consider the multidisciplinary approach comprising of nanotechnology, biochemistry, and immunology to study the complex immunological responses for the rational designing of the nanotherapeutic platform.",

While macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates and protein) serve as the source of both energy and structural building blocks of the organism, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are required for various physiological processes including energy metabolism.\nNutrients, metabolism and gene expression\n\nThe interaction between micronutrients and macronutrients sets the stage for a complex interaction network of different metabolic pathways, the outcome of which will determine the health of the individual. Deregulation of such interaction networks can have long-term effects on health.\nRecent national surveys have identified Vitamin D deficiency as a major form of malnutrition in India. It is associated with metabolic disorders and immune dysfunction.\nVitamin D is required for functioning of multiple organ systems including muscles, bones, intestines etc. But how its requirements and functions vary under different metabolic and pathological conditions is not known. Since metabolic homeostasis involves multiple organs, an imbalance in one system affects others leading to a domino effect. An integrated understanding of the role of vitamin D in intra- and inter-organ interactions that maintain metabolic homeostasis is essential to devise next-generation public health policy regarding nutritional requirements.\nOur work revolves around the premise that the requirements and functions of micronutrients depend on feeding habits and the ratio of different macronutrients in the staple diet.\nTo elucidate the effects of nutrient-metabolic interactions, we employ a systems level approach that integrates multiple organ systems. We use genomics and molecular biology tools to elucidate the effect of nutrient-metabolic interactions in different vitamin D target organs/tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, intestine, and bones.\nMaintenance of metabolic homeostasis by vitamin D (for more details, please see lab website: https://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home ) Recently we have shown that in the absence of systemic vitamin D signalling, skeletal muscles of mice exhibit a glycogen storage disorder characterized by increased glycogen synthase, reduced glycogen phosphorylase and lower glycogen branching enzyme. Glycogen storage deregulation in muscles is also associated with other diseases including McArdle disease (Das et al., 2022). We have also shown that specially formulated milk-based diets could restore muscle energy levels by circumventing the need for glycogen as energy source (Das et al., 2023).\nMaintenance of metabolic homeostasis by vitamin D\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home\n\nMetabolic regulation of gene expression in immune cells (for more details, please see lab website: https://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home ) We are also interested in understanding how gene regulation is altered by metabolism at cellular level. We use immune cells as a model system to study this. We have shown that resting state B cells exhibit increased protein synthesis due to higher levels of mTORC1 activity (Khalsa et. al., 2019, Dev et. al., 2022).\nMetabolic regulation of gene expression in immune cells\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/nii.ac.in/molgenlab/home",

Combining biochemistry, genetics, and computational modeling tools, we have been investigating the role of these cross-regulatory mechanisms in physiology and disease. We are examining crosstalk between the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and those beyond NF-κB signaling. We are biochemically characterizing crosstalk mechanisms integrating cellular pathways within a network and exploring if such crosstalks have functional relevance for I). inflammation and inflammation-associated ailments, including cancer, or II). for anti-viral immunity.\nWe argue that our crosstalk studies may inform improved therapeutic regimes, which specifically target signaling crosstalk, in the future.",
      "research_summary": "A multitude of biochemical processes links the intracellular signaling pathways into an interconnected network. It is this network — rather than individual pathways — that ultimately shapes how cells respond. Due to its complexity, assigning specific roles to individual signaling modules in immune function has been challenging. Using a systems biology approach, we investigate the crosstalk between these signaling pathways and assess their influence on both normal physiology and disease. Our research focuses on the functional significance of such interdependent signaling in two key areas:\n\nI. Inflammation and Inflammation-Associated Diseases\nMicrobial agents activate the canonical RelA NF-κB pathway, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. While this response is essential for innate immunity, overactivation of RelA can result in inflammatory diseases. Separately, the non-canonical RelB NF-κB pathway is crucial for the development of lymphoid organs and immune cells.\n\nWe are particularly interested in how these NF-κB pathways interact with the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, and whether this crosstalk regulates inflammation. Disruption of this balance may contribute to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CAC).\n\nOur approach integrates:\n\nIn silico computational modeling of inflammatory signaling,\n\nEx vivo biochemical analyses using knockout cells,\n\nIn vivo validation in mouse models of IBD and CAC.\n\nThis integrated strategy aims to uncover how signaling networks regulate inflammation and identify targets for treating chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nII. Antiviral Immune Responses\nViral infections activate both RelA NF-κB and IRF3 pathways. RelA contributes to antiviral defense in two ways:\n\nIt promotes cytokine/chemokine production, which helps recruit CD8+ T cells.\n\nAlongside IRF3, it induces type-1 interferons, key antiviral molecules.\n\nHowever, RelA also enhances survival of infected cells, potentially increasing viral replication. In contrast, the non-canonical RelB NF-κB pathway suppresses interferon responses and modulates lymphoid organ function, helping contain viral spread.\n\nWe are investigating how these opposing pathways interact during infection by:\n\nStudying Chandipura virus (linked to encephalitis in India), and\n\nChikungunya virus (a global threat exacerbated by climate change).\n\nUsing a combination of ex vivo cell signaling and mouse infection models, we aim to understand how signaling crosstalk influences viral pathogenesis and explore therapeutic targets for future antiviral interventions.",

These structural principles are being used to develop novel knowledge based computational methods for prediction of substrate specificity of proteins and also for predicting structural folds for proteins in absence of detectable sequence homology. Such computational tools can assign specific functions to various putative proteins in genomes and hence help in identification of novel metabolic pathways and protein interaction networks in newly sequenced genomes.\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway s Prediction of substrate specificity of proteins has been a difficult task due to the lack of suitable scoring functions for accurate evaluation of protein-ligand interactions. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that reliable prediction of substrate specificity can be carried out by combining evolutionary information from large number of proteins of known substrates, with structural information on active site geometry from homologous crystal structures. This work has provided a computational framework for correlating chemical structures of the polyketide or nonribosomal peptide products to the sequences of their respective megasynthases consisting of a variety of catalytic domains. Collaborative experimental work has demonstrated that these computational methods are not only useful in identification of biosynthetic products of uncharacterized proteins in newly sequenced genomes, they can also be used for rational design of novel natural products.\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway\nSubstrate specificity of biosynthetic proteins & identification of novel metabolic pathway\ns\n\nWe are currently extending such predictions of structural fold and substrate specificity to other enzyme families with the objective of developing powerful computational methods for correlating sequence of other classes of biosynthetic proteins to their metabolic products, not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes. Similar computational approach is also being used to analyze enzymes associated with novel post translational modifications like AMPylation, Eliminylation etc.\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks Our research group is also investigating whether knowledge based structural bioinformatics approaches can be used for identifying protein interaction networks mediated by peptide recognition modules (PRMs) like kinases, SH3, SH2, WW, PDZ etc.   Even though, a number of computational methods have been developed for identifying interaction partners of various PRMs, most of these studies have used a sequence based approach and have identified interaction partners based on motifs/profiles obtained from sequence analysis of a known set of experimentally identified interaction partners. Thus the applicability of such training based methods is limited to only those families of PRMs for which experimental substrate data is available. Therefore it is necessary to develop structure based approaches, which do not require training using experimental substrate data.  We have developed a knowledge based computational protocol for modeling structures of protein-peptide complexes and used this protocol to formulate a novel structure based approach for predicting substrates of protein kinases and MHC proteins.  The success of our structure based approach for protein kinases and MHCs encouraged us to develop similar structure based multi-scale approaches for deciphering substrate specificities of other PRMs like PDZ, WW, SH2, SH3 etc.\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks\nPrediction of protein-peptide interaction & identification of protein interaction networks\n\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features Apart from the approach of predicting metabolic and signaling networks based on substrate specificity or function of the component proteins, we also plan to use the systems biology approach of deciphering novel metabolic, signaling and transcriptional networks based on identification of conserved network motifs/modules and understanding their dynamic features.\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features\nSystems biology approach for identification of conserved network modules & deciphering their dynamic features",

These synthetic oligonucleotides enable precise manipulation of gene function within cells, opening new avenues for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.

However, certain transcription factors can still access their target sites to open the chromatin and initiate transcription. Our interest is in understanding how such transcription factors access their binding motifs in the chromatin using structure modelling based approaches in conjunction is NGS based high throughput data. Availability of nucleosome positioning data, x-ray structures of transcription factors and ChIP-seq of transcription factors in public databases give opportunities to understand gene regulation.

We trust in the amazing capacity of the body to adjust to the insults/adverse conditions to maintain homeostasis. So far, the role of individual organs or cells has been the major focus of research. However, the detailsof how multiorgan’scommunicate and maintain homeostasis arelargely unknown. Thus, there exists a tremendous scope to learnand discover novel processes. Here at NII, our laboratory is actively involved in understanding such communication processes among multi-organs using the mouse genetic models of obesity and associated metabolic diseases like diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, etc.\nBroadly, our group is involved in learning about the following areas:\n\n1. How do multi-organs communicate in high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders like diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases?\n2. What are the messenger molecules (biofactors and/or hormones) that effectuate metabolic homeostasis?\n   3. Could organ-specific targeting be established as a better therapeutic platform for metabolic diseases?",

      "research_summary": "We are interested in the investigation of the significance, structure, and functional roles of glycoconjugates – which include glycoproteins (GP), glycolipids (GL), glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors, and bacterial-derived capsular polysaccharides (CPS), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans (PG) – in fundamental biological and immunological processes using the tools of chemical biology, in an interdisciplinary manner.\nAmong more than 30 post-translational modifications (PTM) that are known to date – http://selene.princeton.edu/PTMCuration/ , glycosylation is the most complex. Unlike template-driven biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, glycans are bio-synthesized through non-template driven metabolic pathways. Glycans are linear or branched oligosaccharide or polysaccharide chains wherein monosaccharides are connected through a ‘glycosidic bond’. Like nucleotides for genes and amino acid building blocks for proteins, mammalian systems employ a limited number of monosaccharide building blocks for glycan biosynthesis ( Ref : for beginners and advanced level – Essential of Glycobiology, 2nd ed., Varki, A., et al (2009);\n\nResearch in glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry for more than a century has established that carbohydrates constituting the ‘glycocalyx’ on mammalian cell surface govern cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. Glycans regulate biological processes such as fertilization, differentiation, migration, immune response, and homeostasis. Importance of carbohydrates in day-to-day life are established in the context of blood group antigens, tissue transplantation, vaccines against infectious bacteria, drugs for treatment of influenza, and biopharmaceuticals.\nStructure-function correlation studies of glycans have been hampered not only because of inherent complexity, but also by lack of tools to address challenges. While synthesis of nucleotides and peptides could be achieved routinely with automation no such technologies exist for oligosaccharides. Proteins and nucleotides could be visualised using fluorescence techniques but not glycans. However, post-genomic era has seen rapid growth in realization of importance of glycoforms in biomedicine and development of tools to address challenges unique to study of glycans. These include LC-MS based methodologies, development of metabolic glycans engineering (MGE) in living animals, selective inhibitors of glycan biosynthesis, and array technologies (glycan and lectin arrays).\n\nHow do cell surface glycans, either dependent or independent of the protein carrier, regulate biological/immunological processes? How to develop small molecules that could intercept or alter biosynthesis of glycans thus enabling carbohydrate-based drug development? How to deliver carbohydrate based small molecules across blood brain barrier (BBB) to central nervous system (CNS) for study of role of glycosylation in neurological development and diseases?

We apply protecting / de-protecting methodologies, glycosidation reactions, and armed-disarmed strategies for stereochemical control. We employ TLC, flash column chromatography, and HPLC for purifications and NMR (1H and 13C) and mass spectrometry for characterization of small molecules.\nEnzymatic studies: We develop and conduct biochemical inhibition assays – based on absorbance / fluorescence spectrometers – using enzymes in vitro for evaluation of catalysis and inhibition by small molecules.\n\nIn vitro biochemistry: We evaluate effect of small molecules on cellular physiology, including glycosylation pathways, using mammalian cell lines followed by western blotting, immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA, and enzymatic assays.\n\nIn vitro cell biology: We evaluate small molecules for effects using techniques such as flow cytometry and microscopy. We establish cell lines that stably express tagged (e.g. FLAG) cell surface glycoproteins to facilitate their isolation, purification, and characterization.\n\nGlycomics and glycoproteomics: For characterization of glycans from glycoproteins, cells, or tissues we employ enzymatic deglycosylation and reductive elimination. Glycans are permethylated and characterized by MALDI-TOF MS. Alternatively, released glycans are derivatized with fluorophores for analysis by UPLC. We develop novel tools and methodologies to facilitate identification and characterization of mammalian glycoproteome using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS based approaches.\nAnimal studies: Based on outcome of in vitro cellular and biochemical studies, we evaluate our small molecules in multiple strains of mice in vivo for delivery to CNS and modulation of glycoforms of cell surface antigens and its consequences.",

      "research_summary": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are heterogeneous cell populations, comprised of various subsets that collectively provide early innate immunity leading to subsequent adaptive immune responses. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), CD8α + DCs, CD4 + DCs and CD8-CD4- DCs are four major DC subsets in mouse spleen and bone marrow cultures. Among DCs, pDCs and CD8α + DCs produce very high levels of type I Interferon (IFN) and IL12 respectively that help to establish anti-viral anti-microbial states in the body. In a simplified system of DC classification, CD8α + DC and equivalent population from various tissues is classified as cDC1 whereas CD4 + DC equivalent population is classified as cDC2 subtype.\n\nMembers of Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play a critical role in DC development and functions. IRF4 and IRF8 together govern the molecular program regulating DC subset development and functional diversity. Studies from knockout mouse model led to identification of critical role for Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 ( Id2 ), Basic leucine zipper transcription factor 3 ( Batf3 ) in development of CD8α + DC. We reported that Irf8 is upstream of Batf3 and Id2 in the classical CD8α + DC developmental program and demonstrated that Batf3 and Id2 had a synergistic effect on Irf8 directed developmental process ( J. Immunol. 2013, 191:5993-6001 ).\n\nAnalyzing of the effect of Irf8 on TGF-β super family specific gene expression in DCs in lab led to identification of Acvrl1 , a type I TGF-β superfamily receptor, as a gene strongly induced by Irf8 expression. We showed that among various DC subtypes, Acvrl1 is differentially expressed in CD8α + DCs. ACVRL1 signaling augmented Irf8 -directed classical CD8α + DC development. IRF8R294C mutation in BXH2 mice abolishes the development of CD8α+ DCs without impairing pDC development and eliminates production of IL12p40, while retaining that of type I IFNs. IRF8 R294C mutant failed to induce ACVRL1 transcription which co-related with defect in development of CD8α+ DCs in BXH2 mice. Irf8 expression is essential for plasmacytoid DC and CD8α + DC development and ACVRL1 signaling plays a pivotal role whereby it suppresses plasmacytoid DC development while enhancing that of CD8α + DCs, thus contributing to DC diversity development. The major pathways and the detailed biochemical mechanisms regulating the DC development and functions remains poorly understood.\n\nMain focus of my lab would be to understand the role of IRFs in DC biology and examining role of DC subsets in various pathological conditions.",

Microbiome-Based Nutritional Therapy: A New Arsenal Against Toxoplasma gondii-Induced Obesity\n   Approximately one-third of the global population is estimated to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a parasite known not only for its widespread prevalence but also for its ability to subtly alter human behavior during latent infection. In immunocompromised individuals, T. gondii infections can lead to vision loss or severe brain damage. The absence of effective vaccines and the side effects of existing treatments highlight the need for innovative therapeutic strategies.\n\nIn our lab, we have developed a novel therapeutic approach targeting T. gondii by using small molecules that activate host cell suicide mechanisms, thereby eliminating the parasite residing within. Our research further explores how T. gondii infection disrupts the synchrony between the gut microbiome and metabolic rhythms.\n\nWe hypothesize that the competition between symbionts and pathobionts influences the balance between tolerance (Treg/Tr1/Breg/Br1) and inflammation (Th1/Th17/inflammatory B1). Chronic infection leads to persistent inflammation, contributing to obesity.\n\nThis translational research focuses on:\n\nInvestigating how probiotics restore gut homeostasis\n\nDiscovering microbiome-derived anti-inflammatory small molecules\n\nCountering T. gondii-induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity\n\n2. Antidiabetic Drugs as Therapeutic Agents Against Pan-SARS-CoV-2 Infections\n   In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our laboratory has discovered that antidiabetic drugs, particularly sitagliptin and linagliptin, may mitigate infections caused by multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nKey findings:\n\nThe receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 variants can bind to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), in addition to ACE2, as an entry route.\n\nWe aim to disrupt RBD interactions with both ACE2 and DPP4 to block viral entry across all SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nUsing structure-assisted drug design and live virus assays, our research demonstrates that sitagliptin and linagliptin significantly inhibit viral replication of major variants of concern (VOCs) including the original, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Kappa clades.\n\nThis study not only suggests a new use for conventional diabetes drugs in viral therapy but also contributes to the development of broad-spectrum antivirals for future pandemics.\n\nOur ongoing mission is to harness these insights to reshape COVID-19 treatment paradigms and contribute to a healthier, virus-resilient future.",

The recent advances in understanding of tumor metabolism have provided an insight into the metabolic changes that augment proliferation, and, also the diverse mechanistic and context-dependent determinants that can trigger the metabolic reprogramming. The mechanisms underlying the communication between metabolic pathways and cell signalling networks are complex and have key roles in determining disease progression. Studies suggest that most metabolic pathways cross-talk with the machinery that controls gene expression. However, the molecular details of how the cytoplasmic signalling from metabolic state is conveyed to chromatin remodelling for congruent gene transcription remains poorly understood. The focus of our studies is to understand molecular perturbations that contribute to epigenomic-metabolic interplay in cancers. Using transcriptomics, RNA interference and proteomic screens we plan to delineate novel connections between the metabolic and the gene expression machinery. The current focus of the lab is on transcriptional regulators such as various HDACs and sirtuins which drive metabolic rewiring. Elucidating the role of metabolic enzymes such as PKM2, ACLY, SDHA and IDH1 which promote epigenetic plasticity underlying the malignant phenotype is also an area of notable interest in our research group.
