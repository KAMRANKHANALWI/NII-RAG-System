      "abstract": "The rapid determination of waste-water quality of waste-water treatment plants in terms of pollutional strength, i.e. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is difficult or even impossible using the chemical determination method. The present study reports the determination of BOD within minutes using microbial BOD sensors, as compared to the 5-day determination using the conventional method. Multiple criteria establish the basis for the development of a BOD biosensor useful for rapid and reliable BOD estimation in industrial waste-waters. Of these, preparation of a suitable novel immobilized microbial membrane used in conjunction with an apt transducer is discussed. As a result, a microbial biosensor based on a formulated, synergistic, pre-tested microbial consortium has been developed for the measurement of BOD load of various industrial waste-waters. The sensor showed maximum response in terms of current difference, when a cell concentration of 2.25 x 10(10) CFU, harvested in their log phase of growth were utilized for microbial membrane construction. The sensor showed a stability of 180 days when the prepared membranes were stored at a temperature of 4 degrees C in 50 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6.8. The reusability of the immobilized membranes was up to 200 cycles without appreciable loss of their response characteristics. A linear relationship between the current change and a glucose-glutamic acid (GAA) concentration up to 60 mg l(-1) was observed (r=0.999). The lower detection limit was 1.0 mg l(-1) BOD. The sensor response was reproducible within +/-5% of the mean in a series of ten samples having 44 mg l(-1) BOD using standard a GGA solution. When used for the BOD estimation of industrial waste-waters, a relatively good agreement was found between the two methods, i.e. 5-day BOD and that measured by the developed microbial sensor.",

      "abstract": "India has a large number of paper manufacturing units, with mills varying in size of operations and type of product, scattered all over the length and breadth of the country. Present study deals with the survey of four different pulp and paper mills (Mill A, Mill B, Mill C and Mill D) in India, differing in their scale of operation as well as raw material usage. Physico-chemical characterization of wastewaters produced by different processing units like digestor house liquors, bleaching section, paper machine backwaters, combined inlet to the ETP and outlet to ETP, for all the four mills, was conducted. Different parameters like pH, Color, COD, BOD, percent Na, SAR, TDS and Total hardness were analyzed and compared. Highly significant differences were thus found between all the processing units of all four mills with p values < 0.01. This evaluation showed that though these mills have effluent treatment facilities installed in their premises, improvements are still needed to increase their efficiencies for treating the discharged wastewaters.",

      "abstract": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are novel candidates for drug development. Here we describe design of six short and potent CAMPs (SA-1 to SA-6) based on a minimalist template of 12 residues H+HHG+HH+HH+NH2 (where H: hydrophobic amino acid and +: charged hydrophilic amino acid). Designed peptides exhibit good antibacterial activity in micro molar concentration range (1-32 mug/ml) and rapid clearance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains at concentrations higher than MIC. For elucidating mode of action of designed peptides various biophysical studies including CD and Trp fluorescence were performed using model membranes. Further based on activity, selectivity and membrane bound structure; modes of action of Trp rich peptide SA-3 and template based peptide SA-4 were compared. Calcein dye leakage and transmission electron microscopic studies with model membranes exhibited selective membrane active mode of action for peptide SA-3 and SA-4. Extending our work from model membranes to intact E. coli ATCC 11775 in scanning electron micrographs we could visualize different patterns of surface perturbation caused by peptide SA-3 and SA-4. Further at low concentration rapid translocation of FITC-tagged peptide SA-3 into the cytoplasm of E. coli cells without concomitant membrane perturbation indicates involvement of intracellular targeting mechanism as an alternate mode of action as was also evidenced in DNA retardation assay. For peptide SA-4 concentration dependent translocation into the bacterial cytoplasm along with membrane perturbation was observed. Establishment of a non specific membrane lytic mode of action of these peptides makes them suitable candidates for drug development.",

      "abstract": "The molecular basis for the survival of bacteria under extreme conditions in which growth is inhibited is a question of great current interest. A preliminary study was carried out to determine residue pattern conservation among the antiporters of enteric bacteria, responsible for extreme acid sensitivity especially in Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri. Here we found the molecular evidence that proved the relationship between E. coli and S. flexneri. Multiple sequence alignment of the gadC coded acid sensitive antiporter showed many conserved residue patterns at regular intervals at the N-terminal region. It was observed that as the alignment approaches towards the C-terminal, the number of conserved residues decreases, indicating that the N-terminal region of this protein has much active role when compared to the carboxyl terminal. The motif, FHLVFFLLLGG, is well conserved within the entire gadC coded protein at the amino terminal. The motif is also partially conserved among other antiporters (which are not coded by gadC) but involved in acid sensitive/resistance mechanism. Phylogenetic cluster analysis proves the relationship of Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri. The gadC coded proteins are converged as a clade and diverged from other antiporters belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily.",

There are many microorganisms from archaeal and bacterial domain that can fix carbon dioxide through six known CO₂ fixing pathways. These organisms are ubiquitous and can survive in wide range of aerobic and anaerobic habitats. This review focuses on the prior research, that has been conducted in this field and presents a summarized overview of all the mechanisms (along with their genes and enzymes) used by these microbes for CO₂ incorporation. In addition, this review provides a better understanding of diversity and taxonomy of CO₂ fixing microorganisms. The information presented here will motivate researchers to further explore the diversity of CO₂ fixing microorganisms as well as to decipher the underlying mechanisms of CO₂ utilization.",

Different parameters were optimized (inoculum size, agitation, and temperature) to achieve effective results in less period of time. The results obtained indicated that consortium in the ratio of 1 : 2 (effluent : biomass) at 200 rpm, 35°C is capable of effectively reducing the pollutional load of the sewage wastewaters, in terms of COD, BOD, TSS, and MLSS within the desired discharge limits, that is, 32 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 162 mg/L, and 190 mg/L.

Secondary structure and fold recognition prediction of N-terminal A domain of this protein (210 amino acid) was performed in Genesilico Metaserver and 3DJury. The consensus result from these servers suggested MJ_1460 as a template. Three dimensional structures were generated from the sequence structure alignments of the template and target protein with MODELLER. The results suggested that the N-terminal A domain of DmpR belongs to Muramoyl pentapeptide carboxypeptidase domain family. The binding interaction sites of the known effectors were predicted using protein-ligand docking. The proposed active site of N-terminal A domain of DmpR comprises of key residues such as Phe93, Glu127, Phe132, Ser160, Phe163, Met164, Arg166 and Pro189. The findings provide some direction to the experimental studies that aim to broaden the range of phenolic derivative which can be sensed by N-DmpR in order to improve the biodegradation potential.",

These mills use Kraft pulping process for paper manufacturing due to which toxic lignified chemicals are released into the environment. Lack of infrastructure, technical manpower, and research and development facilities restricts these mills to recover these chemicals. Therefore, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the emanating stream is quite high. For solving the above problem, four bacteria were isolated from the premises of agro-based pulp and paper mill which were identified as species of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Pannonibacter, and Ochrobacterum. These bacteria were found capable of reducing COD up to 85%-86.5% in case of back water and 65-66% in case of back water : black liquor (60:40), respectively, after acclimatization under optimized conditions (pH 6.8, temperature 35°C, and shaking 200 rpm) when the wastewater was supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus as trace elements.",

Here, we have used a serial enrichment approach to identify new potential inhibitors by searching the libraries of compounds using both 2D atom pair descriptors and binary fingerprints followed by molecular docking. Three different docking softwares AutoDock, GOLD, and LigandFit were used for docking calculations. In addition, we applied the criteria of selecting compounds with binding efficiency close to the starting known inhibitor and showing potential to form hydrogen bonds with the active site amino acid residues. The starting inhibitor was ethyl-3-phenoxybenzyl-butylphosphonate, which had IC(50) value of 2.0 μM in mycolyltransferase inhibition assay. Our search from more than 34 million compounds from public libraries yielded 49 compounds. Subsequently, selection was restricted to compounds conforming to the Lipinski rule of five and exhibiting hydrogen bonding to any of the amino acid residues in the active site pocket of all three proteins of antigen 85A, 85B, and 85C. Finally, we selected those ligands which were ranked top in the table with other known decoys in all the docking results. The compound NIH415032 from tuberculosis antimicrobial acquisition and coordinating facility was further examined using molecular dynamics simulations for 10 ns. These results showed that the binding is stable, although some of the hydrogen bond atom pairs varied through the course of simulation. The NIH415032 has antitubercular properties with IC(90) at 20 μg/ml (53.023 μM). These results will be helpful to the medicinal chemists for developing new antitubercular molecules for testing.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: The detection of bioavailable phenol is a very important issue in environmental and human hazard assessment. Despite modest developments recently, there is a stern need for development of novel biosensors with high sensitivity for priority phenol pollutants. DmpR (Dimethyl phenol regulatory protein), an NtrC-like regulatory protein for the phenol degradation of Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600, represents an attractive biosensor regimen. Thus, we sought to design a novel biosensor by modifying the phenol detection capacity of DmpR by using mutagenic PCR. METHODS: Binding sites of 'A' domain of DmpR were predicted by LIGSITE, and molecular docking was performed by using GOLD to identify the regions where phenol may interact with DmpR. Total five point mutations, one single at position 42 (Phe-to-Leu), two double at 140 (Asp-to-Glu) and 143 (Gln-to-Leu), and two double at L113M (Leu-to- Met) and D116A (Asp-to- Ala) were created in DmpR by site-directed mutagenesis to construct the reporter plasmids pRLuc42R, pRLuc140p143R, and pRLuc113p116R, respectively. Luciferase assays were performed to measure the activity of luc gene in the presence of phenol and its derivatives, while RT-PCR was used to check the expression of luc gene in the presence of phenol. RESULTS: Only pRLuc42R and pRLuc113p116R showed positive responses to phenolic effectors. The lowest detectable concentration of phenol was 0.5 µM (0.047 mg/L), 0.1 µM for 2, 4-dimethylphenol and 2-nitrophenol, 10 µM for 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol and 2-chlorophenol, 100 µM for 2, 4-dichlorophenol, 0.01 µM for 4-nitrophenol, and 1 µM for o-cresol. These concentrations were measured by modified luciferase assay within 3 hrs compared to 6-7 hrs in previous studies. Importantly, increased expression of luciferase gene of pRLuc42R was observed by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The present study offers an effective strategy to design a quick and sensitive biosensor for phenol by constructing recombinant bacteria having DmpR gene.",

The present study deals with the estimation of BOD of dairy wastewater using a specific microbial consortium and compares of the results with seeding material (BODSEED). Bacterial strains were isolated from 5 different sources and were screened by the conventional BOD method. The selected microbial seed comprises of Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp. BOD : COD (Chemical oxygen demand) ratio using the formulated seed comes in the range of 0.7-0.8 whereas that using BODSEED comes in the ratio of 0.5-0.6. The ultimate BOD (UBOD) was also performed by exceeding the 3-day dilution BOD test. After 90 days, it has been observed that the ratio of BOD : COD increased in case of selected consortium 7 up to 0.91 in comparison to 0.74 by BODSEED.

The DNA G+C content of strain 12/1(T) was 55.6 mol%, major respiratory isoprenoid quinone was MK-7, major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine and the cell-wall peptidoglycan was of the A3α l-Lys-Gly type, characteristics consistent with its affiliation to the genus Exiguobacterium. Strain 12/1(T) showed levels of DNA-DNA hybridization of less than 70 % with the closely related species of the genus Exiguobacterium. Overall, the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data presented in this study suggest that strain 12/1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium, for which the name Exiguobacterium alkaliphilum sp. nov. is proposed.

Uncontrolled use of antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs, and any change in the diet pattern usually contribute to the changes in the colony index of sensitive strains known to release microbial content in the tissue micromilieu. Ligands released from dying microbes induce Toll-like receptor (TLR) mimicry, skew hypoxia, and cause sterile inflammation, which further contributes to the severity of inflammatory, autoimmune, and tumorous diseases.

      "abstract": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a microbiota-derived metabolite has been implicated in human health and disease. Its early detection in body fluids has been presumed to be significant in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of many diseases. Hence, the development of reliable and rapid technologies for TMAO detection may augment our understanding of pathogenesis and diagnosis of diseases that TMAO has implicated. The present work is the first report on the development of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based electrochemical sensor for sensitive and selective detection of TMAO in body fluids. The MIP developed was based on the polypyrrole (PPy), which was synthesized via chemical oxidation polymerization method, with and without the presence of TMAO. The MIP, NIP and the non-sonicated polymer (PPy-TMAO) were separately deposited electrophoretically onto the hydrolyzed indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glasses. The chemical, morphological, and electrochemical behavior of MIP, non-imprinted polymer (NIP), and PPy-TMAO were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical techniques. The detection response was recorded using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), which revealed a decrease in the peak current with the increase in concentration of TMAO. The MIP sensor showed a dynamic detection range of 1-15 ppm with a sensitivity of 2.47 µA mL ppm-1 cm-2. The developed sensor is easy to construct and operate and is also highly selective to detect TMAO in body fluids such as urine. The present research provides a basis for innovative strategies to develop sensors based on MIP to detect other metabolites derived from gut microbiota that are implicated in human health and diseases.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 an international health emergency due to the severity of infection progression, which became more severe due to its continuous spread globally and the unavailability of appropriate therapy and diagnostics systems. Thus, there is a need for efficient devices to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early stage. Nowadays, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique is being applied for detecting this virus around the globe; however, factors such as stringent expertise, long diagnostic times, invasive and painful screening, and high costs have restricted the use of RT-PCR methods for rapid diagnostics. Therefore, the development of cost-effective, portable, sensitive, prompt and selective sensing systems to detect SARS-CoV-2 in biofluids at fM/pM/nM concentrations would be a breakthrough in diagnostics. Immunosensors that show increased specificity and sensitivity are considerably fast and do not imply costly reagents or instruments, reducing the cost for COVID-19 detection. The current developments in immunosensors perhaps signify the most significant opportunity for a rapid assay to detect COVID-19, without the need of highly skilled professionals and specialized tools to interpret results. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can also be equipped with this immunosensing approach to investigate useful networking through database management, sharing, and analytics to prevent and manage COVID-19. Herein, we represent the collective concepts of biomarker-based immunosensors along with AI and IoMT as smart sensing strategies with bioinformatics approach to monitor non-invasive early stage SARS-CoV-2 development, with fast point-of-care (POC) diagnostics as the crucial goal. This approach should be implemented quickly and verified practicality for clinical samples before being set in the present times for mass-diagnostic research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Based on recent research reports, dysbiosis and improper concentrations of microbial metabolites in the gut may result into the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent advancement also highlights the involvement of bacteria and their secreted metabolites in the cancer causation. Gut microbial metabolites are functional output of the host-microbiota interactions and produced by anaerobic fermentation of food components in the diet. They contribute to influence variety of biological mechanisms including inflammation, cell signaling, cell-cycle disruption which are majorly disrupted in carcinogenic activities. PURPOSE: In this review, we intend to discuss recent updates and possible molecular mechanisms to provide the role of bacterial metabolites, gut bacteria and diet in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Recent evidences have proposed the role of bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleaturm, Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium septicum, in the carcinogenesis of CRC. Metagenomic study confirmed that these bacteria are in increased abundance in CRC patient as compared to healthy individuals and can cause inflammation and DNA damage which can lead to development of cancer. These bacteria produce metabolites, such as secondary bile salts from primary bile salts, hydrogen sulfide, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which are likely to promote inflammation and subsequently cancer development. CONCLUSION: Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota-derived metabolites have a role in CRC progression and causation and hence, could be implicated in CRC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Among gut microbiota-derived metabolites, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is receiving increased attention due to its possible role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In spite of numerous reports implicating TMAO with CRC, there is a lack of empirical mechanistic evidences to concretize the involvement of TMAO in the carcinogenesis of CRC. Possible mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and protein misfolding by TMAO have been discussed in this review in the light of the latest advancements in the field. This review is an attempt to discuss the probable correlation between TMAO and CRC but this linkage can be concretized only once we get sufficient empirical evidences from the mechanistic studies. We believe, this review will augment the understanding of linking TMAO with CRC and will motivate researchers to move towards mechanistic study for reinforcing the idea of implicating TMAO with CRC causation. KEY POINTS: • TMAO is a gut bacterial metabolite which has been implicated in CRC in recent years. • The valid mechanistic approach of CRC causation by TMAO is unknown. • The article summarizes the possible mechanisms which need to be explored for validation.",

      "abstract": "Bone-related diseases have been increasing worldwide, and several nanocomposites have been used to treat them. Among several nanocomposites, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based nanocomposites are widely used in drug delivery and tissue engineering due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, PHB use in bone tissue engineering is limited due to its inadequate physicochemical and mechanical properties. In the present work, we synthesized PHB-based nanocomposites using a nanoblend and nano-clay with modified montmorillonite (MMT) as a filler. MMT was modified using trimethyl stearyl ammonium (TMSA). Nanoblend and nano-clay were fabricated using the solvent-casting technique. Inspection of the composite structure revealed that the basal spacing of the polymeric matrix material was significantly altered depending on the loading percentage of organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) nano-clay. The PHB/OMMT nanocomposite displayed enhanced thermal stability and upper working temperature upon heating as compared to the pristine polymer. The dispersed (OMMT) nano-clay assisted in the formation of pores on the surface of the polymer. The pore size was proportional to the weight percentage of OMMT. Further morphological analysis of these blends was carried out through FESEM. The obtained nanocomposites exhibited augmented properties over neat PHB and could have an abundance of applications in the industry and medicinal sectors. In particular, improved porosity, non-immunogenic nature, and strong biocompatibility suggest their effective application in bone tissue engineering. Thus, PHB/OMMT nanocomposites are a promising candidate for 3D organ printing, lab-on-a-chip scaffold engineering, and bone tissue engineering.",

However, the effect of TMA in the colon and the underlying mechanism was not clear. In this study, TMA exhibited toxic effects in vitro as well as in vivo. TMA-induced oxidative stress causes DNA damage, and compromised cell membrane integrity leading to the release of LDH outside the cells which ultimately leads to cell death. Besides, TMA also exhibited pronounced increase in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in both HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. TMA was found to be genotoxic and cytotoxic as the TMA concentration increased from 0.15 mM. A decreased ATP intracellular content was observed after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner. For in vivo research, TMA (100 mM, i.p. and intra-rectal) once a week for 12 weeks caused significant changes in cellular morphology of colon and rectum epithelium as assessed by H & E staining. TMA also significantly increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colon and rectal epithelium indicating the severity of inflammation. In addition, TMA caused extensive mucosal damage and distortion in the epithelium, decrease in length of small intestine compared to control mice. In conclusion, these results highlight the detrimental effects of TMA in the colon and rectal epithelium.",

      "abstract": "Uncontrolled waste generation and management difficulties are causing chaos in the ecosystem. Although it is vital to ease environmental pressures, right now there is no such practical strategy available for the treatment or utilisation of waste material. Because the Earth's resources are limited, a long-term, sustainable, and sensible solution is necessary. Currently waste material has drawn a lot of attention as a renewable resource. Utilisation of residual biomass leftovers appears as a green and sustainable approach to lessen the waste burden on Earth while meeting the demand for bio-based goods. Several biopolymers are available from renewable waste sources that have the potential to be used in a variety of industries for a wide range of applications. Natural and synthetic biopolymers have significant advantages over petroleum-based polymers in terms of cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and user-friendliness. Using waste as a raw material through industrial symbiosis should be taken into account as one of the strategies to achieve more economic and environmental value through inter-firm collaboration on the path to a near-zero waste society. This review extensively explores the different biopolymers which can be extracted from several waste material sources and that further have potential applications in food packaging industries to enhance the shelf life of perishables. This review-based study also provides key insights into the different strategies and techniques that have been developed recently to extract biopolymers from different waste byproducts and their feasibility in practical applications for the food packaging business.",

      "abstract": "Bioethanol is recognized as a valuable substitute for renewable energy sources to meet the fuel and energy demand of the nation, considered an environmentally friendly resource obtained from agricultural residues such as sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, husk, wheat straw and corn stover. The energy demand is sustained using lignocellulosic biomass to produce bioethanol. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCBs) is the point of attention in replacing the dependence on fossil fuels. The recalcitrant structure of the lignocellulosic biomass is disrupted using effective pretreatment techniques that separate complex interlinked structures among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Pretreatment of biomass involves various physical, chemical, biological, and physiochemical protocols which are of importance, dependent upon their individual or combined dissolution effect. Physical pretreatment involves a reduction in the size of the biomass using mechanical, extrusion, irradiation, and sonification methods while chemical pretreatment involves the breaking of various bonds present in the LCB structure. This can be obtained by using an acidic, alkaline, ionic liquid, and organosolvent methods. Biological pretreatment is considered an environment-friendly and safe process involving various bacterial and fungal microorganisms. Distinct pretreatment methods, when combined and utilized in synchronization lead to more effective disruption of LCB, making biomass more accessible for further processing. These could be utilized in terms of their effectiveness for a particular type of cellulosic fiber and are namely steam explosion, liquid hot water, ammonia fibre explosion, CO2 explosion, and wet air oxidation methods. The present review encircles various distinct and integrated pretreatment processes developed till now and their advancement according to the current trend and future aspects to make lignocellulosic biomass available for further hydrolysis and fermentation.Keywords: Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biological pretreatment; Chemical pretreatment; Lignocellulosic structure; Physical pretreatment.",

To match the requirement in the market, suitable food packaging alternatives have to be developed that are biodegradable and environment-friendly. The current work is designed for the fabrication of a novel nanocomposite by blending xanthan gum in a chitosan matrix and reinforcing it with ZnO nanoparticles, through a solution casting method. Surface morphology of the film was investigated through field emission scanning electron microscopy, along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping, and characterized through thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, mechanical testing, and ultraviolet spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy analysis corroborated the interaction between the components and the H-bond formation. Polyelectrolyte complex formation materializes between the oppositely charged chitosan and xanthan gum, and further nanoparticle incorporation significantly improves the mechanical properties. The synthesized nanocomposite was found to have increases in the tensile strength and elongation at break of pure chitosan by up to 6.65 and 3.57 times, respectively. The transmittance percentage of the bionanocomposite film was reduced compared to that of the pure chitosan film, which aids in lowering the oxidative damage brought on by UV radiation in packed food products. Moreover, the film also showed an enhanced barrier property against water vapor and oxygen gas. The film was totally biodegradable in soil burial at the end of the second month; it lost almost around 88% of its initial weight. The fabricated film does not pose a threat to the environment and hence has great potential for application in the future sustainable food packaging industry.",

The Indian traditional medicine Triphala, a rich source of polyphenols, has been used on humans based on Prakriti or disease conditions for many years. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, the dual mode (morning and evening) action of Triphala is used to provide scientific evidence of its superior preventive and therapeutic efficacy in C57BL/6 and 5xFAD, APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The study observes that Triphala treatment has significantly improved cognitive function, by modulating the APP pathway, reducing inflammation, and restoring the gut-brain axis by increasing the gut microbiota phyla of Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, etc., involved in maintaining the gut homeostasis.

Due to various surgical interventions and the requirement of bone substitutes, the emerging field of bone tissue engineering attempts to repair damaged tissues with the help of scaffolds. These scaffolds act as template for bone regeneration by controlling the development of new cells. For the creation of functional tissues and organs, there are three elements of bone tissue engineering that play very crucial role: cells, signals and scaffolds. For the achievement of these aims, various types of natural polymers, like chitosan, chitin, cellulose, albumin and silk fibroin, have been used for the preparation of scaffolds. Scaffolds produced from natural polymers have many advantages: they are less immunogenic as well as being biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic and cost effective. The hierarchal structure of bone, from microscale to nanoscale, is mostly made up of organic and inorganic components like nanohydroxyapatite and collagen components. This review paper summarizes the knowledge and updates the information about the use of natural polymers for the preparation of scaffolds, with their application in recent research trends and development in the area of bone tissue engineering (BTE). The article extensively explores the related research to analyze the advancement of nanotechnology for the treatment of bone-related diseases and bone repair.",

This article presents a method for selective enriching the M. morganii in human fecal samples. This method includes prior incubation of fecal microbiota in an anaerobic environment, adding supplement like fecal water to give dormant bacteria a break to become active to grow to threshold concentration, and an enrichment stage which provides the additional opportunity of growing to M. morganii on the selective medium.

Therefore, the development of rapid and sensitive technologies for 4-EPS detection is of significant importance for clinical diagnosis. In the current work, the synthesis of a molecularly imprinted biopolymer (MIBP) carrying 4-EPS specific cavities only using the biopolymer polydopamine (PDA) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets has been reported. The fabricated electrode was prepared using screen-printed carbon electrodes on a polyvinyl chloride substrate. The synthesized material was characterized using several techniques, and electrochemical studies were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. The DPV technique for the electrochemical sensing of 4-EPS using the fabricated sensor (PDA@MoS2-MIBP) determined a sensitivity of 0.012 μA/ng mL/cm2 and a limit of detection of 30 ng/mL in a broad linear range of 1-2200 ng/mL. Also, the interferent study was performed to evaluate the selectivity of the fabricated sensor along with the control and stability study. Moreover, the performance of the sensor was evaluated in the spiked urine sample, and a comparison was made with the data obtained by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy.",

      "abstract": "Traditional medication and alternative therapies have long been used to treat breast cancer. One of the main problems with current treatments is that there is an increase in drug resistance in the cancer cells owing to genetic differences such as mutational changes, epigenetic changes and miRNA (microRNA) alterations such as miR-1246, miR-298, miR-27b and miR-33a, along with epigenetic modifications, such as Histone3 acetylation and CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) hypermethylation for drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines. Certain forms of conventional drug resistance have been linked to genetic changes in genes such as ABCB1, AKT, S100A8/A9, TAGLN2 and NPM. This review aims to explore the current approaches to counter breast cancer, the action mechanism, along with novel therapeutic methods endowing potential drug resistance. The investigation of novel therapeutic approaches sheds light on the phenomenon of drug resistance including genetic variations that impact distinct forms of oestrogen receptor (ER) cancer, genetic changes, epigenetics-reported resistance and their identification in patients. Long-term effective therapy for breast cancer includes selective oestrogen receptor modulators, selective oestrogen receptor degraders and genetic variations, such as mutations in nuclear genes, epigenetic modifications and miRNA alterations in target proteins. Novel research addressing combinational therapies including maytansine, photodynamic therapy, guajadiol, talazoparib, COX2 inhibitors and miRNA 1246 inhibitors have been developed to improve patient survival rates.",

The complex known-unknown elements of the gut microbiome are perplexing and the absence of standardized procedures for collecting and preserving samples has hindered continuous research in comprehending it. The technological bias produced because of lack of standard protocols has affected the reproducibility of results. The complex nature of diseases like colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer require a thorough understanding of its etiology for an efficient and timely diagnosis. The designated protocols for collection and preservation of stool specimens have great variance, hence generate inconsistencies in OMICS studies. Due to the complications associated to the nature of sample, it is important to preserve the sample to be studied later in a laboratory or to be used in the future research purpose. Stool preservation is gaining importance due to the increased use of treatment options like fecal microbiota transplantation to cure conditions like recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and for OMICS studies including metagenomics, metabolomics and culturomics. This review provides an insight into the importance of omics studies for the identification and development of novel biomarkers for quick and noninvasive diagnosis of various diseases.",

Its altered level in the serum has been implicated in human health and diseases such as colorectal cancer, chronic kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, etc. Early detection of TMAO in body fluids has been presumed to be significant in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of many diseases. Hence, developing reliable and rapid technologies for its detection may augment our understanding of pathogenesis and diagnosis of diseases. Hence, in the present work, polypyrrole (Ppy)@molybdenum(III)sulfide (Mo2S3) nanosheets (NS) composite molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) (Ppy@Mo2S3-MIP) based electrochemical sensor has been fabricated for the detection of TMAO. Polypyrrole (Ppy) and Mo2S3 NS have been synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization and hydrothermal techniques, respectively. The synthesized nanocomposite has been validated using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fabricated Ppy@Mo2S3-MIP sensor showed a linear detection range from 30 µM to 210 µM, a sensitivity of 1.21 μA μM-1 cm-2 and a limit of detection as 1.4 μM for the detection of TMAO and found more robust and improved when compared with Ppy-MIP using identical parameters. The fabricated sensor is also highly selective towards TMAO. It can be further used to detect TMAO in human samples such as urine quickly.",

An imbalance of SCFAs can result in various acute and chronic diseases, including diabetes, obesity and colorectal cancer (CRC). This review delves into the multifaceted roles of SCFAs, including a brief discussion on their source and various gut-residing bacteria. Primary techniques used for detection of SCFAs, including gas chromatography, high-performance gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance and capillary electrophoresis are also discussed through this article. This review study also compiles various synthesis pathways of SCFAs from diverse substrates such as sugar, acetone, ethanol and amino acids. The different pathways through which SCFAs enter cells for immune response regulation are also highlighted. A major emphasis is the discussion on diseases associated with SCFA dysregulation, such as anaemia, brain development, CRC, depression, obesity and diabetes. This includes exploring the relationship between SCFA levels across ethnicities and their connection with blood pressure and CRC. In conclusion, this review highlights the critical role of SCFAs in maintaining gut health and their implications in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research on SCFA detection, synthesis and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Future studies of SCFAs will pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for optimizing gut health and preventing diseases associated with SCFA dysregulation.",

As per recent advances in the field, gut metabolites after their formation goes to blood stream crosses blood brain barrier and causes neuro related problems. Increased levels of 4-EPS in human body causes anxiety in patients and its role remains elusive. 4-EPS interacts with serum albumin in human body and thus, a model study of interaction of BSA with 4-EPS is presented in support of it. Absorption spectroscopy result demonstrated decrease in bovine serum albumin (BSA) absorption upon interaction with increasing concentration of EPS in a range from 2 μM to 100 μM. Moreover, this interaction was confirmed by the fluorescence quenching in presence of metabolite. The change in secondary structure was demonstrated by circular dichroism, synchronous fluorescence and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. Docking studies reveals binding score of -5.28 Kcal mol-1, demarking that 4-EPS is involved in interaction with BSA via amino acid residues, forming the stable complex. This interaction study may be helpful in devising strategies for the treatment of chronic kidney disease and other neuro related diseases, by producing synthetic compound that competes with albumin binding sites to allow 4-EPS clearance from the body.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is an economically important crop, yet weed management remains a significant challenge due to limited herbicide options. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in plant metabolism, including herbicide detoxification. This study aimed to identify and characterize the CYP gene family in Cannabis and investigate their potential role in herbicide metabolism. We identified 225 CYP proteins encoded by 221 genes in the Cannabis genome, classified into 9 clans and 47 families. The majority of CsCYPs were predicted to be located in endomembrane system and chromosomal mapping revealed that they were present in all the chromosomes. Motif and gene structure analysis supported the results from phylogenetic analysis. The gene duplication analysis results showed that tandem duplication plays a pivotal role in evolutionary expansion of CsCYP superfamily. Promoter analysis revealed various cis-acting elements involved in stress, light, hormone and development responses. Molecular docking simulations identified several CsCYPs with strong binding affinities to ALS-inhibiting herbicides, particularly bispyribac-sodium, propoxycarbazone-sodium, and pyriftalid. CsCYP_215, CsCYP_213, CsCYP_217 and CsCYP_14 emerged as promising candidates for herbicide metabolism. Analysis of binding site residues revealed the importance of hydrophobic and aromatic interactions in herbicide binding. This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the CYP gene family in C. sativa and offers new insights into their potential roles in herbicide metabolism. The identification of promising herbicide-metabolizing CYP candidates opens new avenues for developing herbicide-tolerant Cannabis varieties, potentially addressing key challenges in weed management and crop productivity.",

      "abstract": "The human microbiome is the complex ecosystem consisting of trillions of microorganisms that play a key role in developing the immune system and nutrient metabolism. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been linked to cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Accumulating evidence suggests that levels of vitamins and minerals influence the gut environment and may have implications for cancer risk and progression. Bifidobacterium has been reported to reduce the colorectal cancer risk by binding to free iron. Additionally, zinc ions have been shown to activate the immune cells and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Higher selenium levels have been associated with a reduced risk of several cancers, including colorectal cancer. In contrast, enhanced copper uptake has been implicated in promoting cancer progression, including colon cancer. The interaction between cancer and gut bacteria, as well as dysbiosis impact has been studied in animal models. The interplay between prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics and gut bacteria in cancer offers the diverse physiological benefits. We also explored the particular probiotic formulations like VSL#3, Prohep, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), etc., for their ability to modulate immune responses and reduce tumor burden in preclinical models. Targeting the gut microbiome through antibiotics, bacteriophage, microbiome transplantation-based therapies will offer a new perspective in cancer research. Hence, to understand this interplay, we outline the importance of micronutrients with an emphasis on the immunomodulatory function of the microbiome and highlight the microbiome's potential as a target for precision medicine in cancer treatment.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antagonistic effect of L-NAT on the Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor and substance P inhibition was determined using molecular docking and Elisa assays. The in  RESULTS: Molecular docking studies revealed a strong binding of L-NAT with TRPV1 receptor at similar binding pockets to which capsaicin, an agonist of the TRPV1 receptor, binds. Further, capsaicin and gamma radiation were found to induce substance P levels in the intestines and serum of the mice, while L-NAT pretreatment was found to inhibit it. Significant whole-body survival (>80%) was observed in irradiated (9.0 Gy) mice that pretreated with L-NAT (150 mg/kg, b.wt. im) compared to 0% survival in irradiated mice that not pretreated with L-NAT. The quantitative histology of the hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and male reproductive systems demonstrated significant protection against radiation-induced cellular degeneration. Interestingly, 100% survival was observed with irradiated NHPs (6.5 Gy) that pretreated with L-NAT (37.5 mg/kg, b.wt.im). Significant improvement in the hematology profile was observed after days 10-20 post-treatment periods in irradiated (6.5 Gy) NHPs that were pretreated with L-NAT. CONCLUSION: L-NAT demonstrated excellent radioprotective activity in the mice and NHP models, probably by antagonizing TRPV1 receptor and subsequently inhibiting substance P expression.",

With the advancement in science and technology, significant progress has been achieved in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer to make ends meet. The scientific intradisciplinary subject of \"metabolomics\" examines every metabolite found in a cell, tissue, system, or organism from different sources of samples. In the case of breast cancer, little is known about the regulatory pathways that could be resolved through metabolic reprogramming. Evidence related to the significant changes taking place during the onset and prognosis of breast cancer can be obtained using metabolomics. Innovative metabolomics approaches identify metabolites that lead to the discovery of biomarkers for breast cancer therapy, diagnosis, and early detection. The use of diverse analytical methods and instruments for metabolomics includes Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, LC/MS, UPLC/MS, etc., which, along with their high-throughput analysis, give insights into the metabolites and the molecular pathways involved. For instance, metabolome research has led to the discovery of the glutamate-to-glutamate ratio and aerobic glycolysis as biomarkers in breast cancer. The present review comprehends the updates in metabolomic research and its processes that contribute to breast cancer prognosis and metastasis. The metabolome holds a future, and this review is an attempt to amalgamate the present relevant literature that might yield crucial insights for creating innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing metastatic breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Excess consumption of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance that hinders the control and cure of microbial diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the antibiotic levels in the environment. In this proposed research work, an optical nano-sensor was devised that can sense the ultra-low concentration of antibiotics, in samples like tap water using fluorescent zinc oxide quantum dots (ZnO QDs) based nano-sensor. For this, different polymers (polyvinylalcohol-PVA and polyvinylpyrrolidine-PVP) capped florescent ZnO QDs were synthesized using a modified sol-gel technique. These were used as fluorescent probes to monitor the presence of antibiotics. The optical characterizations of synthesized QDs were performed using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic methods while structural characteristics were analyzed by using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The formation of capped QDs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Charge on the synthesized QDs was obtained with the help of ZETA potential. Here ten different antibiotics were checked, Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin have shown excellent sensing and specificity with PVA-ZnO QDs and PVP-ZnO QDs with LOD of 1.4 nM and 0.8 nM, and sensitivity of 36.17 units/mM and 19.33 units/mM respectively. This study also inferred the tuning of the ZnO QDs properties and specificity towards the different antibiotics can be achieved by capping QDs with different polymers.",

      "abstract": "Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is gut microbiota-derived metabolite, plays a critical role in human health and diseases such as metabolic, cardiovascular, colorectal cancer and, neurological disorders. Binding interactions between TMAO and serum albumins are crucial to understand the impact of TMAO on disease mechanisms. However, detailed insights into the interaction mechanisms, preferred binding locations, and conformational changes in BSA upon binding TMAO are still unclear. TMAO interacts with serum albumin in human body and thus, a model study of interaction for TMAO-BSA conjugate is presented in support of it. Decrease in absorbance intensity of protein upon interaction with metabolites reveals conjugate formation, while fluorescence spectroscopy indicate static quenching. Contact angle measurements further reveal the hydrophilic nature of the TMAO-BSA complex, while CD and FTIR support conformational changes in BSA upon binding but structure remain intact. Computational studies, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and, MM/GBSA, confirm a stable complex with a binding energy of - 3.6 kcal/mol. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of TMAO and may aid in developing strategies for treating diseases, such as chronic kidney disease and neurological disorder where TMAO-serum albumins interaction are implicated.",

The pathogenesis has not been entirely understood including the key risk factors related to PCa development like diet and microbiota derived metabolites. Microbiota may influence the host's immunological responses, inflammatory responses, and metabolic pathways, which may be crucial for the development and metastasis. Similarly, short-chain fatty acids, methylamines, hippurate, bile acids, and other metabolites generated by microbiota may have potential roles in cancer inflammation and progression of cancer. Most studies have focused on the role of metabolites and their pathways involved in chronic inflammation, tumor initiation, proliferation, and progression. In summary, the review discusses the role of microbiota and microbial-derived metabolite-built strategies in inflammation and progression of the PCa.",

      "abstract": "Papaver somniferum L. (Family: Papaveraceae) is a species well known for its diverse alkaloids (100 different benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs)). L-tyrosine serves as a precursor of several specific metabolites like BIAs. It has been used as an antitussive and potent analgesic to alleviate mild to extreme pain since ancient times. The extraction of pharmaceutically important alkaloids like morphine and codeine from poppy plant reflects the need for the most suitable and standard methods. Several analytical and extraction techniques have been reported in open literature for morphine, codeine and other important alkaloids which play a vital function in drug development and drug discovery. Many studies suggest that opioids are also responsible for adverse effects or secondary complications like dependence and withdrawal. In recent years, opium consumption and addiction are the most important risk factors. Many evidence-based reviews suggest that opium consumption is directly linked or acts as a risk factor for different cancers. In this review, we highlight significant efforts related to research which have been done over the past 5 decades and the complete information on Papaver somniferum including its phytochemistry, pharmacological actions, biosynthetic pathways and analytical techniques of opium alkaloid extraction and the link between opium consumption and cancer-related updates.",
