      "abstract": "In this study we have investigated the heat induced denaturation of HSA by utilizing spectroscopic approaches including fluorescence and circular dichroism. Thermal denaturation of N isomer (domains I-III remain intact), B isomer (loss of helical structure of interdomain contacts) and I state (domain II intact) was found to be co-operative processes while for F isomer domains unfold non-cooperatively. These finding pointed out that during N-F transition, HSA suffers more structural alterations which are not localized only to domain III. Loss of secondary structure in the temperature range 20-60 °C without effecting tertiary structure of N isomer of HSA is mainly due to loss in helical extensions connecting domain I to II and domain II to III. All the four thermally denatured states (60-96 °C) of HSA retained approximately 50% residual α-helical structures. Near-UV spectroscopy used as a probe for tertiary structure indicated that heat denatured states lost almost all of the tertiary contacts thereby forming molten globule like states. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that residual helical structures are mainly located in domain II.",

      "abstract": "The binding of ciprofloxacin (CFX) to human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated by fluorescence displacement and induced circular dichroism (ICD) measurements. Displacement measurements were performed with CFX in the absence and presence of marker ligands (hemin for domain I, bilirubin for interspace of domain IA and IIA, chloroform for domain II, and diazepam for domain III) to establish CFX binding site in one of the three major domains of HSA. The primary binding site of CFX is located in site I of HSA (domain IIA) in close vicinity to the site where chloroform (CHCl3) binds. It is depicted from the decrease in quenching constant of HSA-CHCl3 system (0.02 ± 0.06) × 10(-3 )L mol(-1) compared to HSA-CFX-CHCl3 system (0.01 ± 0.06) × 10(-3 )L mol(-1) as obtained by the fluorescence displacement spectroscopy. Furthermore, far-UV CD results show that the binding of CFX leads to change in the helicity of HSA. The ICD results indicated that the CFX binds to the domain IIA of HSA which is in agreement with the fluorescence displacement results.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol (TFE) and acetonitrile (ACN) on the stability, behavior, and structural characteristics of giant multimeric protein Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin (KLH) by combining the circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence measurements of KLH solution. In concentration range 20-50% (v/v) TFE, protein at pH 7.4 shows visible aggregation while no aggregation was observed in the entire concentration range of TFE at molten globule (MG) state (pH 2.8) and resulted in stable α-helix. Our result shows that in the presence of 80% (v/v) and 40% (v/v) TFE, at native (pH 7.4) and MG state (pH 2.8) occurred in a highly helical state referred to as TFE denatured state I and II, respectively. However, in case of ACN, aggregation starts above 40% (v/v) for pH 7.4 and at 80% (v/v) for acid-induced MG (pH 2.8) state, which was dominated by β-sheet structure and referred to as ACN denatured state III and IV. An important object of our investigation is to get more detail study of efficiency of cosolvents in inducing structural changes in KLH. The dependence of scattering intensity and the R h on alcohol concentrations was investigated at 25 °C.",

      "abstract": "Uremic syndrome results from malfunctioning of various organ systems due to the retention of uremic toxins which, under normal conditions, would be excreted into the urine and/or metabolized by the kidneys. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the renal elimination of uremic toxin creatinine that accumulate in chronic renal failure. Quantitative investigation of the plausible correlations was performed by spectroscopy, calorimetry, molecular docking and accessibility of surface area. Alkalinization of normal plasma from pH 7.0 to 9.0 modifies the distribution of toxin in the body and therefore may affect both the accumulation and the rate of toxin elimination. The ligand loading of HSA with uremic toxin predicts several key side chain interactions of site I that presumably have the potential to impact the specificity and impaired drug binding. These findings provide useful information for elucidating the complicated mechanism of toxin disposition in renal disease state.",

      "abstract": "Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is widely used as an immune stimulant and hapten carrier derived from a marine mollusc Megathura crenulata. To provide details of the stability and equilibrium of KLH, different intermediate species were investigated with a series of biophysical techniques: circular dichroism, binding of hydrophobic dye, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid, acrylamide-induced fluorescence quenching, thermal stability and dynamic light scattering. KLH in its native state at pH 7.4 exists in the stable didecameric form with hydrodynamic radii (Rh) of 28.22 nm, which is approximately equal to a molecular mass of 8.8+/-0.6 MDa. The experimental results demonstrated the presence of two structurally distinct species in the conformational transition of KLH under acidic conditions. One species populates at pH 2.8, characterized as decameric (4.8+/-0.2 MDa; Rh=22.02 nm), molten globule-like state, while the other accumulates at pH 1.2 and is characterized as a tetramer (2.4+/-0.8 MDa; Rh=16.47 nm) with more organized secondary and tertiary structures. Our experimental manipulation of the oligomeric states of KLH has provided data that correlate well with the known oligomeric forms obtained from total KLH formed in vivo and extends our understanding of multimer formation by KLH. The results are of particular interest in light of the important role of the mechanistic pathway of pH-dependent structural changes of Hc stability in the biochemical and medical applications of these respiratory proteins.",

Pa-2 is an acidic monomeric lectin and acquires random coil conformation at neutral pH without any regular secondary structure. As confirmed by different spectroscopic techniques, on lowering the pH, some secondary structures, predominantly alpha-helices, are detected by far-UV CD that adopt a marginally stable partially folded collapsed conformation possessing the characteristics of a premolten globule state. It is in accordance with coil-helix transition that is commonly observed when these intrinsically unordered proteins interact with their partner molecules in vivo.",

Hence, its unfolding/refolding strategies and exogenous/endogenous ligand binding preference are of immense use in therapeutics and clinical biochemistry. Among its fellow proteins albumin is known to carry almost every small molecule. Thus, it is a potential contender for being a molecular cargo/or nanovehicle for clinical, biophysical and industrial purposes. Nonetheless, its structure and function are largely regulated by various chemical and physical factors to accommodate HSA to its functional purpose. This multifunctional protein also possesses enzymatic properties which may be used to convert prodrugs to active therapeutics. This review aims to highlight current overview on the binding strategies of protein to various ligands that may be expected to lead to significant clinical applications.",

Proteins stability was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, whereas conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism techniques. We have suggested a \"molten globule\" like intermediate state of HSA at a fairly high concentration of GnHCl (3.2 for fatty acid free and 3.6 for fatted). The free energy of stabilization (DeltaG(D)(H2O)) in the presence of fatty acid was found to be 900 cal mol(-1).
