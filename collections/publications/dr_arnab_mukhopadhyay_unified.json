      "abstract": "The folate and methionine cycles (Met-C) are regulated by vitamin B₁₂ (B₁₂), obtained exclusively from diet and microbiota. Met-C supports amino acid, nucleotide, and lipid biosynthesis and provides one-carbon moieties for methylation reactions. While B₁₂ deficiency and polymorphisms in Met-C genes are clinically attributed to neurological and metabolic disorders, less is known about their cell-non-autonomous regulation of systemic physiological processes. Using a B₁₂-sensitive Caenorhabditis elegans mutant, we show that the neuronal Met-C responds to differential B₁₂ content in diet to regulate p38-MAPK activation in the intestine, thereby modulating cytoprotective gene expression, osmotic stress tolerance, behaviour and longevity. Mechanistically, our data suggest that B₁₂-driven changes in the metabolic flux through the Met-C in the mutant's serotonergic neurons increase serotonin biosynthesis. Serotonin activates its receptor, MOD-1, in the post-synaptic interneurons, which then secretes the neuropeptide FLR-2. FLR-2 binding to its intestinal receptor, FSHR-1, induces the phase transition of the SARM domain protein TIR-1, thereby activating the p38-MAPK pathway. Together, we reveal a dynamic neuron-gut signalling axis that helps an organism modulate life history traits based on the status of neuronal Met-C, determined by B₁₂ availability in its diet.",

      "abstract": "The insulin/IGF-I-like signaling (IIS) pathway is a highly conserved signaling cascade that plays a crucial role in regulating longevity across species. Given its significance in aging, identifying novel kinases interacting with the IIS pathway can provide deeper insights into the mechanisms governing longevity. In this study, we performed a targeted RNAi screening of the Caenorhabditis elegans kinome, using dauer formation as a phenotypic readout. We identified several known and novel kinase modulators of the IIS pathway. These hits were enriched with both previously documented and undocumented lifespan regulators. Thermotolerance assays revealed mixed trends, with some kinase inhibitions increasing while others decreasing protection against thermal stress. We observed a positive correlation between thermotolerance and lifespan extension, as well as between dauer formation and lifespan extension, with thermotolerance proving to be a better predictor of longevity. Our findings offer a valuable resource for researchers exploring the IIS pathway and highlight novel, unannotated kinases as potential new therapeutic targets for aging interventions.",

      "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by Aedes genus mosquitoes and is responsible for dengue fever (DF) and other severe diseases, posing a significant challenge to the global health system. Currently, anti-dengue pharmacological treatment options are not available. Earlier, we demonstrated that Sinococuline has potent anti-dengue activity and prevents virus infection. In this study, we profile the host transcriptome response in the Vero cells after infection with DENV2 in the presence of Sinococuline, using bioinformatics to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A total of 1510 DEGs were noted by transcriptional analysis of Vero cells that were infected with dengue virus as compared to the uninfected cells, among which 697 were upregulated and 813 were downregulated. Also, 184 out of 697 and 254 out of 817 genes were altered in dengue-infected Vero cells in the presence of Sinococuline. We found that TNF, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and NF-kB signaling pathways were differentially expressed in DENV2-infected Vero cells, which was prevented by Sinococuline. The findings of this study add to our knowledge of Sinococuline's antiviral activity in DENV2-infected Vero cells at the transcriptome level. These findings also identify potential candidate antiviral genes that can be verified for their function in the future.",

      "abstract": "For the optimal survival of a species, an organism coordinates its reproductive decisions with the nutrient availability of its niche. Thus, nutrient-sensing pathways like insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS) play an important role in modulating cell division, oogenesis, and reproductive aging. Lowering of the IIS leads to the activation of the downstream FOXO transcription factor (TF) DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans which promotes oocyte quality and delays reproductive aging. However, less is known about how the IIS axis responds to changes in cell cycle proteins, particularly in the somatic tissues. Here, we show a new aspect of the regulation of the germline by this nutrient-sensing axis. First, we show that the canonical G1-S cyclin, Cyclin D/CYD-1, regulates reproductive fidelity from the uterine tissue of wild-type worms. Then, we show that knocking down cyd-1 in the uterine tissue of an IIS receptor mutant arrests oogenesis at the pachytene stage of meiosis-1 in a DAF-16-dependent manner. We observe activated DAF-16-dependent deterioration of the somatic gonadal tissues like the sheath cells, and transcriptional de-regulation of the sperm-to-oocyte switch genes which may be the underlying reason for the absence of oogenesis. Deleting DAF-16 releases the arrest and leads to restoration of the somatic gonad but poor-quality oocytes are produced. Together, our study reveals the unrecognized cell non-autonomous interaction of Cyclin D/CYD-1 and FOXO/DAF-16 in the regulation of oogenesis and reproductive fidelity.",

      "abstract": "An organism encounters an extensive range of dietary choices in its niche. The macronutrient and micronutrient quotients of these diets instruct downstream molecular events, eventually orchestrating complex physiological responses that determine their life-history traits. In response to diverse nutritional inputs, organisms deploy multiple adaptive mechanisms to maintain optimal life span and health. However, we know little about these processes. Although we have come to appreciate the complex relationship between diet and genes in modulating life span in response to diverse nutritional inputs, it can be difficult to identify these interactions in the laboratory, as an organism maintains a normal life span on a wide range of diet. But in rare cases, a mutant laboratory animal, with the mutation attributable to a single gene, may display altered physiological traits on only one diet but not on others. These 'diet-gene pairs' contribute immensely to our understanding of how diet quality influences physiological traits like longevity and health.",

      "abstract": "Germ line integrity is crucial for progeny fitness. Organisms deploy the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to protect the germ line from genotoxic stress, facilitating the cell-cycle arrest of germ cells and DNA repair or their apoptosis. Cell-autonomous regulation of germ line quality in response to DNA damage is well studied; however, how quality is enforced cell non-autonomously on sensing somatic DNA damage is less known. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that DDR disruption, only in the uterus, when insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) is low, arrests oogenesis in the pachytene stage of meiosis I, in a FOXO/DAF-16 transcription factor-dependent manner. Without FOXO/DAF-16, germ cells of the IIS mutant escape the arrest to produce poor-quality oocytes, showing that the transcription factor imposes strict quality control during low IIS. Activated FOXO/DAF-16 senses DDR perturbations during low IIS to lower ERK/MPK-1 signaling below a threshold to promote germ line arrest. Altogether, we elucidate a new surveillance role for activated FOXO/DAF-16 that ensures optimal germ cell quality and progeny fitness in response to somatic DNA damage.",

Here, we present a hydrogel-mediated localized delivery of a combination of docetaxel (DTX) and carboplatin (CPT) (called DTX-CPT-Gel therapy) that ensured enhanced anticancer effect and tumor regression on multiple murine syngeneic and xenograft tumor models. DTX-CPT-Gel therapy modulated the TIME by an increase of antitumorigenic M1 macrophages, attenuation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and increase of granzyme B+CD8+ T cells. DTX-CPT-Gel therapy elevated ceramide levels in tumor tissues that activated the protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR). This UPR-mediated activation of apoptotic cell death led to release of damage-associated molecular patterns, thereby activating the immunogenic cell death that could even clear the metastatic tumors. This study provides a promising hydrogel-mediated platform for DTX-CPT therapy that induces tumor regression and effective immune modulation and, therefore, can be explored further for treatment of TNBC.",

      "abstract": "Aging is associated with changes in circulating levels of various molecules, some of which remain undefined. We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise. Thus, taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents. Clinical trials in humans seem warranted to test whether taurine deficiency might drive aging in humans.",

AGEs are associated with aging and age-related diseases; their formation is aggravated during diabetes. Therefore, drugs preventing AGE formation can potentially treat diabetic complications, positively affecting health. Earlier, we demonstrated that rifampicin and its analogs have potent anti-glycating activities and increase the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans. This study aimed to investigate the effects of rifampicin during hyperglycemia in C. elegans and in a mouse model of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes. The effects of rifampicin were assessed by determining the life span of C. elegans cultured in the presence of glucose and by measuring HbA1c, AGE levels, and glucose excursions in the diabetic mouse model. Our results show that rifampicin protects C. elegans from glucose-induced toxicity and increases life span. In mice, rifampicin reduces HbA1c and AGEs, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces indications of diabetic nephropathy without inducing hepatotoxicity. Rifampicin quinone, an analog with lower anti-microbial activity, also reduces HbA1c levels, improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, and lowers indications of diabetic nephropathy, without adversely affecting the liver of the diabetic mice. Altogether, our results indicate that rifampicin and its analog have protective roles during diabetes without inflicting hepatic damage and may potentially be considered for repositioning to treat hyperglycemia-related complications in patients.",

      "abstract": "Diet regulates complex life-history traits such as longevity. For optimal lifespan, organisms employ intricate adaptive mechanisms whose molecular underpinnings are less known. We show that Caenorhabditis elegans FLR-4 kinase prevents lifespan differentials on the bacterial diet having higher Vitamin B₁₂ levels. The flr-4 mutants are more responsive to the higher B₁₂ levels of Escherichia coli HT115 diet, and consequently, have enhanced flux through the one-carbon cycle. Mechanistically, a higher level of B₁₂ transcriptionally downregulates the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase pmt-2 gene, which modulates phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels. Pmt-2 downregulation activates cytoprotective gene expression through the p38-MAPK pathway, leading to increased lifespan only in the mutant. Evidently, preventing bacterial B₁₂ uptake or inhibiting one-carbon metabolism reverses all the above phenotypes. Conversely, supplementation of B₁₂ to E. coli OP50 or genetically reducing PC levels in the OP50-fed mutant extends lifespan. Together, we reveal how worms maintain adaptive capacity to diets having varying micronutrient content to ensure a normal lifespan.",

      "abstract": "Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) plays a crucial, conserved role in development, growth, reproduction, stress tolerance, and longevity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the enhanced longevity under reduced insulin signaling (rIIS) is primarily regulated by the transcription factors (TFs) DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/Nrf-1, and HSF1/HSF-1. The specific and coordinated regulation of gene expression by these TFs under rIIS has not been comprehensively elucidated. Here, using RNA-sequencing analysis, we report a systematic study of the complexity of TF-dependent target gene interactions during rIIS under analogous genetic and experimental conditions. We found that DAF-16 regulates only a fraction of the C. elegans transcriptome but controls a large set of genes under rIIS; SKN-1 and HSF-1 show the opposite trend. Both of the latter TFs function as activators and repressors to a similar extent, while DAF-16 is predominantly an activator. For expression of the genes commonly regulated by TFs under rIIS conditions, DAF-16 is the principal determining factor, dominating over the other two TFs, irrespective of whether they activate or repress these genes. The functional annotations and regulatory networks presented in this study provide novel insights into the complexity of the gene regulatory networks downstream of the IIS pathway that controls diverse phenotypes, including longevity.",

DDSMs were experimentally validated in the cancerous colon tissues obtained from an independent cohort of colon cancer patients and in multiple cellular systems with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. All the tested DDSMs were transcriptionally upregulated by a common intestine-specific transcription factor, CDX2. Reciprocally, DDSMs were repressed via the recruitment of HDAC1/2-containing complexes onto the CDX2 promoter. These miRs downregulated multiple key targets in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, namely BRCA1, ATM, Chk1 (also known as CHEK1) and RNF8. CDX2 directly regulated the DDSMs, which led to increased tumor volume and metastasis in multiple preclinical models. In colon cancer patient tissues, the DDSMs negatively correlated with BRCA1 levels, were associated with decreased probability of survival and thereby could be used as a prognostic biomarker.

Here, we present specific signature of alternative splicing (AS) events of sphingolipid genes for each breast cancer subtype from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. We show that ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) undergoes a unique cassette exon event specifically in Luminal B subtype tumors. We validated this exon 8 skipping event in Luminal B cancer cells compared to normal epithelial cells, and in patient-derived tumor tissues compared to matched normal tissues. Differential AS-based survival analysis shows that this AS event of CERS2 is a poor prognostic factor for Luminal B patients. As Exon 8 corresponds to catalytic Lag1p domain, overexpression of AS transcript of CERS2 in Luminal B cancer cells leads to a reduction in the level of very-long-chain ceramides compared to overexpression of protein-coding (PC) transcript of CERS2. We further demonstrate that this AS event-mediated decrease of very-long-chain ceramides leads to enhanced cancer cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, our results show subtype-specific AS of sphingolipid genes as a regulatory mechanism that deregulates sphingolipids like ceramides in breast tumors, and can be explored further as a suitable therapeutic target.",

Administration of DTX-PC NMs decelerate tumor progression and increase the mice survivability compared to Taxotere (DTX-TS), the FDA-approved formulation of DTX. Unlike DTX-TS, DTX-PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non-rodent species including non-human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX-PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression.

In C. elegans, as in other models, DR leads to reprogramming of metabolism, improvements in mitochondrial health, large changes in expression of cytoprotective genes and better proteostasis. Understandably, multiple global transcriptional regulators like transcription factors FOXO/DAF-16, FOXA/PHA-4, HSF1/HSF-1 and NRF2/SKN-1 are important for DR longevity. Considering the wide-ranging effects of p53 on organismal biology, we asked whether the C. elegans ortholog, CEP-1 is required for DR-mediated longevity assurance. We employed the widely-used TJ1 strain of cep-1(gk138). We show that cep-1(gk138) suppresses the life span extension of two genetic paradigms of DR, but two non-genetic modes of DR remain unaffected in this strain. We find that two aspects of DR, increased autophagy and up-regulation of the expression of cytoprotective xenobiotic detoxification program (cXDP) genes, are dampened in cep-1(gk138). Importantly, we find that background mutation(s) in the strain may be the actual cause for the phenotypic differences that we observed and cep-1 may not be directly involved in genetic DR-mediated longevity assurance in worms. Identifying these mutation(s) may reveal a novel regulator of longevity required specifically by genetic modes of DR.",

Dietary restriction (DR), which positively affects health and life span across species, leads to metabolic reprogramming that enhances utilisation of fatty acids for energy generation. One direct consequence of this metabolic shift is the upregulation of cytoprotective (CyTP) genes categorized in the Gene Ontology (GO) term of \"Xenobiotic Detoxification Program\" (XDP). How an organism senses metabolic changes during nutritional stress to alter gene expression programs is less known. Here, using a genetic model of DR, we show that the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are increased following DR and these PUFAs are able to activate the CyTP genes. This activation of CyTP genes is mediated by the conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway. Consequently, genes of the PUFA biosynthesis and p38-MAPK pathway are required for multiple paradigms of DR-mediated longevity, suggesting conservation of mechanism. Thus, our study shows that PUFAs and p38-MAPK pathway function downstream of DR to help communicate the metabolic state of an organism to regulate expression of CyTP genes, ensuring extended life span.",

The ability to mount an effective UPRER to external stress (iUPRER) decreases with age and is linked to the pathophysiology of multiple age-related disorders. Here, we show that a transient pharmacological ER stress, imposed early in development on Caenorhabditis elegans, enhances proteostasis, prevents iUPRER decline with age, and increases adult life span. Importantly, dietary restriction (DR), that has a conserved positive effect on life span, employs this mechanism of ER hormesis for longevity assurance. We found that only the IRE-1-XBP-1 branch of UPRER is required for the longevity effects, resulting in increased ER-associated degradation (ERAD) gene expression and degradation of ER resident proteins during DR. Further, both ER hormesis and DR protect against polyglutamine aggregation in an IRE-1-dependent manner. We show that the DR-specific FOXA transcription factor PHA-4 transcriptionally regulates the genes required for ER homeostasis and is required for ER preconditioning-induced life span extension. Finally, we show that ER hormesis improves proteostasis and viability in a mammalian cellular model of neurodegenerative disease.

Here we show that, during dietary restriction (DR), AS is enhanced in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. A splicing mediator hrpu-1 regulates a significant part of these AS events in C. elegans; knocking it down suppresses DR-mediated longevity. Concurrently, due to increased AS, NMD pathway genes are upregulated and knocking down UPF1 homologue smg-2 suppresses DR lifespan. Knockdown of NMD during DR significantly increases the inclusion of PTC-containing introns and the lengths of the 3'UTRs. Finally, we demonstrate that PHA-4/FOXA transcriptionally regulates the AS-NMD genes. Our study suggests that DR uses AS to amplify the proteome, supporting physiological remodelling required for enhanced longevity. This increases the dependence on NMD, but also helps fine-tune the expression of metabolic and splicing mediators. AS-NMD may thus provide an energetically favourable level of dynamic gene expression control during dietary restriction.Alternative splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD) is a conserved mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here, the authors provide evidence that AS-NMD is enhanced during dietary restriction (DR) and is required for DR-mediated longevity assurance in C. elegans.",

This study examines its genome-wide role by profiling Ncb2 occupancy between genetically matched pair of azole sensitive (AS) and AR clinical isolates. A comparison of Ncb2 recruitment between the two isolates displayed that 29 genes had higher promoter occupancy of Ncb2 in the AR isolate. Additionally, a host of genes exhibited exclusive occupancy of Ncb2 at promoters of either AR or AS isolate. The analysis also divulged new actors of multi-drug resistance, whose transcription was activated owing to the differential occupancy of Ncb2. The conditional, sequence-specific positional escape of Ncb2 from the core promoter in AS isolate and its preferential recruitment to the core promoter of certain genes in AR isolates was most noteworthy means of transcription regulation. Together, we show that positional rearrangement of Ncb2 resulting in either activation or repression of gene expression in response to drug-induced stress, represents a novel regulatory mechanism that opens new opportunities for therapeutic intervention to prevent development of drug tolerance in C. albicans cells.",

Through a comprehensive genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify modulators of reductive stress-induced UPR(ER) and demonstrate that oxidative quality control (OQC) genes modulate this cellular response in the presence of chronic but not acute reductive stress. Using a combination of microarray and relative quantitative proteomics, we uncover a non-canonical translation attenuation mechanism that acts in a bipartite manner to selectively downregulate highly expressed proteins, decoupling the cell's transcriptional and translational response during reductive ER stress. Finally, we demonstrate that PERK, a canonical translation attenuator in higher eukaryotes, helps in bypassing a ROS-dependent, non-canonical mode of translation attenuation.",

Here, we show that both pathways license a common chromatin modifier, ZFP-1/AF10. The downstream transcription factors of the IIS and select DR pathways, DAF-16/FOXO or PHA-4/FOXA, respectively, both transcriptionally regulate the expression of zfp-1. ZFP-1, in turn, negatively regulates the expression of DAF-16/FOXO and PHA-4/FOXA target genes, apparently forming feed-forward loops that control the amplitude as well as the duration of gene expression. We show that ZFP-1 mediates this regulation by negatively influencing the recruitment of DAF-16/FOXO and PHA-4/FOXA to their target promoters. Consequently, zfp-1 is required for the enhanced longevity observed during DR and on knockdown of IIS. Our data reveal how two distinct sensor pathways control an overlapping set of genes, using different downstream transcription factors, integrating potentially diverse and temporally distinct nutritional situations.",

To study the dynamics of FOXO chromatin occupancy under this condition in C. elegans, we report the first recruitment profile of endogenous DAF-16 and show that the response is conserved. DAF-16 predominantly acts as a transcriptional activator and binding within the 0.5 kb promoter-proximal region results in maximum induction of downstream targets that code for proteins involved in detoxification and longevity. Interestingly, genes that are activated under low IIS already have higher DAF-16 recruited to their promoters in WT. DAF-16 binds to variants of the FOXO consensus sequence in the promoter proximal regions of genes that are exclusively targeted during low IIS. We also define a set of 'core' direct targets, after comparing multiple studies, which tend to co-express and contribute robustly towards IIS-associated phenotypes. Additionally, we show that nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 as well as zinc-finger TF EOR-1 may bind DNA in close proximity to DAF-16 and distinct TF classes that are direct targets of DAF-16 may be instrumental in regulating its indirect targets. Together, our study provides fundamental insights into the transcriptional biology of FOXO/DAF-16 and gene regulation downstream of the IIS pathway.",

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed when glucose reacts nonenzymatically with proteins; these modifications are implicated in aging and pathogenesis of many age-related diseases including type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, pharmaceutical interventions that can reduce AGEs may delay age-onset diseases and extend lifespan. Using LC-MS(E), we show that rifampicin (RIF) reduces glycation of important cellular proteins in vivo and consequently increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by up to 60%. RIF analog rifamycin SV (RSV) possesses similar properties, while rifaximin (RMN) lacks antiglycation activity and therefore fails to affect lifespan positively. The efficacy of RIF and RSV as potent antiglycating agents may be attributed to the presence of a p-dihydroxyl moiety that can potentially undergo spontaneous oxidation to yield highly reactive p-quinone structures, a feature absent in RMN. We also show that supplementing rifampicin late in adulthood is sufficient to increase lifespan. For its effect on longevity, rifampicin requires DAF-18 (nematode PTEN) as well as JNK-1 and activates DAF-16, the FOXO homolog. Interestingly, the drug treatment modulates transcription of a different subset of DAF-16 target genes, those not controlled by the conserved Insulin-IGF-1-like signaling pathway. RIF failed to increase the lifespan of daf-16 null mutant despite reducing glycation, showing thereby that DAF-16 may not directly affect AGE formation. Together, our data suggest that the dual ability to reduce glycation in vivo and activate prolongevity processes through DAF-16 makes RIF and RSV effective lifespan-extending interventions.",

      "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span and delays the onset of age-related diseases across species. However, the molecular mechanisms have remained relatively unexplored in terms of gene regulation. InC. elegans, a popular model for aging studies, the FOXA transcription factor PHA-4 is a robust genetic regulator of DR, although little is known about how it regulates gene expression. We profiled the transcriptome and miRNAome of an eat-2 mutant, a genetic surrogate of DR, by Next Generation sequencing and find that most of the miRNAs are upregulated in the young-adult worms, none significantly downregulated. Interestingly, PHA-4 can potentially regulate the expression of most of these miRNA genes. Remarkably, many of the PHA-4-regulated genes that are induced during DR are also targets of the PHA-4-upregulated miRNAs, forming a large feed-forward gene regulatory network. The genes targeted by the feed-forward loops (FFLs) are enriched for functions related to ubiquitin-mediated decay, lysosomal autophagy, cellular signalling, protein folding etc., processes that play critical roles in DR and longevity. Together our data provides a framework for understanding the complex and unique regulatory network employed during DR, suggesting that PHA-4 employs such FFLs to fine-tune gene expression and instil robustness in the system during energy crisis.",

      "abstract": "Although dietary restriction (DR) is known to extend lifespan across species, from yeast to mammals, the signalling events downstream of food/nutrient perception are not well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, DR is typically attained either by using the eat-2 mutants that have reduced pharyngeal pumping leading to lower food intake or by feeding diluted bacterial food to the worms. In this study, we show that knocking down a mammalian MEKK3-like kinase gene, mekk-3 in C. elegans, initiates a process similar to DR without compromising food intake. This DR-like state results in upregulation of beta-oxidation genes through the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49, a HNF-4 homolog, resulting in depletion of stored fat. This metabolic shift leads to low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), potent oxidizing agents that damage macromolecules. Increased beta-oxidation, in turn, induces the phase I and II xenobiotic detoxification genes, through PHA-4/FOXA, NHR-8 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR-1, possibly to purge lipophilic endotoxins generated during fatty acid catabolism. The coupling of a metabolic shift with endotoxin detoxification results in extreme longevity following mekk-3 knock-down. Thus, MEKK-3 may function as an important nutrient sensor and signalling component within the organism that controls metabolism. Knocking down mekk-3 may signal an imminent nutrient crisis that results in initiation of a DR-like state, even when food is plentiful.",

The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway comprises a single receptor, DAF-2. To date, no single insulin-like peptide recapitulates all DAF-2-associated phenotypes, likely due to redundancy between insulin-like genes. To provide a first-level annotation of potential patterns of redundancy, we comprehensively delineate the spatiotemporal and conditional expression of all 40 insulins in living animals. We observe extensive dynamics in expression that can explain the lack of simple patterns of pairwise redundancy. We propose a model in which gene families evolve to attain differential alliances in different tissues and in response to a range of environmental stresses.",

These results fit with a previously proposed mechanism in which the β-catenin FOXO and SIRT1 proteins may together regulate gene expression and cell survival. Knockdown of β-catenin enhanced the vulnerability to cell death of mutant-huntingtin striatal cells derived from the HdhQ111 knock-in mice. In addition, this effect was compensated by SIRT1 overexpression and accompanied by the modulation of neuronal UCP expression levels, further highlighting a cross-talk between β-catenin and SIRT1 in the modulation of mutant polyQ cytoxicity. Taken together, these results suggest that integration of β-catenin, sirtuin and FOXO signaling protects from the early phases of mutant huntingtin toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Signal transduction pathways are tightly regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles and yet the mammalian genome contains far more genes that encode for protein kinases than protein phosphatases. Therefore, to target specific substrates, many phosphatases associate with distinct regulatory subunits and thereby modulate multiple cellular processes. One such example is the C. elegans PP2A regulatory subunit PPTR-1 that negatively regulates the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway to modulate longevity, dauer diapause, fat metabolism and stress resistance. PPTR-1, as well as its mammalian homolog B56beta, specifically target the PP2A enzyme to AKT and mediate the dephosphorylation of this important kinase at a conserved threonine residue. In C. elegans, the major consequence of this modulation is activation of the FOXO transcription factor homolog DAF-16, which in turn regulates transcription of its many target genes involved in longevity and stress resistance. Understanding the function of B56 subunits may have important consequences in diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cancer where the balance of Akt phosphorylation is deregulated.",

The major regulatory control of IIS is through phosphorylation of its components by serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. An RNAi screen for serine/threonine protein phosphatases that counterbalance the effect of the kinases in the IIS pathway identified pptr-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Modulation of pptr-1 affects IIS pathway-associated phenotypes including life span, dauer, stress resistance, and fat storage. We show that PPTR-1 functions by regulating worm AKT-1 phosphorylation at Thr 350. With striking conservation, mammalian B56beta regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In C. elegans, this ultimately leads to changes in subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. This study reveals a conserved role for the B56 regulatory subunit in regulating insulin signaling through AKT dephosphorylation, thereby having widespread implications in cancer and diabetes research.",

Previously, we have shown that TUB-1 interacts with a new Rab GTPase-activating protein, RBG-3, for the regulation of fat storage. To understand further the molecular mechanism of TUB-1, we identified the Rab GTPase downstream of RBG-3. We found that RBG-3 preferentially stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAB-7 in both human and C. elegans. Importantly, either mutation or RNA interference knockdown in rab-7 reduces stored fat in wild type and tub-1 mutants. In addition, the small GTPase rab-5 and genes that regulate Rab membrane localization and nucleotide recycling are required for the regulation of fat storage, thereby defining a role for endocytic recycling in this process. We propose that TUB-1 controls receptor or sensory molecule degradation in neurons by regulating a RAB-7-mediated endocytic pathway.",

This pathway is comprised of many genes including the insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2) that signals through a conserved PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway and ultimately down-regulates DAF-16, a forkhead transcription factor (FOXO). DAF-16 also receives input from several other pathways that regulate life span such as the germline and the JNK pathway [Hsin, H., Kenyon, C., 1999. Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of C. elegans. Nature 399, 362-366; Oh, S.W., Mukhopadhyay, A., Svrzikapa, N., Jiang, F., Davis, R.J., Tissenbaum, H.A., 2005.

Here, we used \"gene-centered\" high-throughput yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays to identify 283 interactions between 72 C. elegans digestive tract gene promoters and 117 proteins. The resulting protein-DNA interaction (PDI) network is highly connected and enriched for TFs that are expressed in the digestive tract. We provide functional annotations for approximately 10% of all worm TFs, many of which were previously uncharacterized, and find ten novel putative TFs, illustrating the power of a gene-centered approach.

We cloned 103 target sequences containing consensus DAF-16 binding sites and selected 33 targets for further analysis. Expression of most of these genes is regulated in a DAF-16-dependent manner, and inactivation of more than half of these genes significantly altered DAF-16-dependent functions, including life span, fat storage and dauer formation. Our results show that the ChIP-based cloning strategy leads to greater enrichment for DAF-16 target genes than previous screening strategies.
