      "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Currently available methods for the prediction of genotypic drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are mostly based on the identification of known resistance associated mutations (RAMs). However, the prediction accuracy is limited by the incomplete knowledge of RAMs. RESULTS: Whole genome sequences with known phenotypic drug resistance profiles have been utilized to train XGBoost and ANN classifiers for 5 first-line and 8 second-line tuberculosis drugs. Benchmarking on a completely independent dataset from CRyPTIC database revealed that our method has high sensitivity (90%-95%) and specificity (94%-99%) for five first-line drugs and robust performance for six second-line drugs with a sensitivity of 77%-89% at over 95% specificity. An explainable AI method, SHapley Additive exPlanations, has successfully identified resistance mutations for each drug in a completely automated way. This approach could not only identify known resistance associated mutations in agreement with the WHO mutation catalogue, but also predicted >100 other potential resistance associated mutations for 13 antibiotics in new genes outside the known resistance loci. Identification of new resistance markers opens up the opportunity for the discovery of novel mechanisms of drug resistance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our prediction method has been implemented as TB-AMRpred webserver and command line tool, available freely at http://www.nii.ac.in/TB-AMRpred.html and https://github.com/Ankitapal1995/TB-AMRprd.",

      "abstract": "The biotransformation of drugs by enzymes from the human microbiome can produce active or inactive products, impacting the bioactivity and function of these drugs inside the human host. However, understanding the biotransformation reactions of drug molecules catalyzed by bacterial enzymes in human microbiota is still limited. Hence, to characterize drug utilization capabilities across all the microbial phyla inside the human gut, we have used a knowledge-based approach to develop HgutMgene-Miner software which predicts xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) through genome mining. HgutMgene-Miner derives its predictive power from the MicrobiomeMetDB database, which systematically catalogs all known biotransformation reactions of xenobiotics and primary metabolites mediated by host-associated microbial enzymes. Over 10,000 isolate genomes from 830 different bacterial species found in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection have been analyzed by HgutMgene-Miner. This led to the identification of 89,377 xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) across 13 phyla, with the greatest diversity in Bacteroidota, Firmicutes_A, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Alitsipes were found to be the richest genera, while Actinomyces were found to encode the fewest XMEs, primarily metabolizing Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Overall, we discovered XMEs in 220 genera, exceeding the number experimentally reported in fewer than 10 genera. Notably, Eggerthella lenta's cgr2 involved in Digoxin inactivation was identified in very distant Holdemania genera, likewise Clostridium leptum's nitroreductase, involved in Nitrazepam metabolism, was found in Fusobacterium. These findings highlight the extensive and diverse distribution of XMEs across microbial taxa.",

      "abstract": "Small proteins (≤100 amino acids) play important roles across all life forms, ranging from unicellular bacteria to higher organisms. In this study, we have developed SProtFP which is a machine learning-based method for functional annotation of prokaryotic small proteins into selected functional categories. SProtFP uses independent artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained using a combination of physicochemical descriptors for classifying small proteins into antitoxin type 2, bacteriocin, DNA-binding, metal-binding, ribosomal protein, RNA-binding, type 1 toxin and type 2 toxin proteins. We have also trained a model for identification of small open reading frame (smORF)-encoded antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Comprehensive benchmarking of SProtFP revealed an average area under the receiver operator curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.92 during 10-fold cross-validation and an ROC-AUC of 0.94 and 0.93 on held-out balanced and imbalanced test sets. Utilizing our method to annotate bacterial isolates from the human gut microbiome, we could identify thousands of remote homologs of known small protein families and assign putative functions to uncharacterized proteins. This highlights the utility of SProtFP for large-scale functional annotation of microbiome datasets, especially in cases where sequence homology is low. SProtFP is freely available at http://www.nii.ac.in/sprotfp.html and can be combined with genome annotation tools such as ProsmORF-pred to uncover the functional repertoire of novel small proteins in bacteria.",

      "abstract": "Computational methods to predict binding affinity of protein-ligand complex have been used extensively to design inhibitors for proteins selected as drug targets. In recent years machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for design of drugs/inhibitors. However, ranking compounds as per their experimental binding affinity has remained a major challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to develop ML-based scoring function (MLSF) for predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. In this work, protein-ligand interaction features, namely, extended connectivity interaction fingerprints (ECIF), derived from the PDBbind dataset have been used to build ML models for binding affinity prediction. The benchmarking has been done on the Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) dataset and also by predicting the binding affinity of unseen protein-ligand complexes which have structural features different from those present in the training dataset. Furthermore, an improvement in the performance of MLSF on the redocked CASF complexes generated by AutoDock Vina software was seen when the training set consisting of crystal structures was supplemented with redocked protein-ligand complexes. The MLSF trained on crystal structures alone using a combination of ECIF and VINA features also predicted binding affinities of crystal as well as docked complexes with high accuracy. Overall, the MLSF developed in this work shows improved performance compared to conventional SFs and several other MLSFs. It will be a valuable resource for identifying novel inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening protocols. The proposed MLSF SG-ML-PLAP (Structure-Guided Machine-Learning-based Protein-Ligand Affinity Predictor) is freely accessible as a webserver, http://www.nii.ac.in/sg-ml-plap.html.",

Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding proteins less than 100 amino acids (aa) are known to be important regulators of key cellular processes. However, their computational identification remains a challenge. Based on a comprehensive analysis of known prokaryotic small ORFs, we have developed the ProsmORF-pred resource which uses a machine learning (ML)-based method for prediction of smORFs in the prokaryotic genome sequences. ProsmORF-pred consists of two ML models, one for initiation site recognition in nucleic acid sequences upstream of putative start codons and the other uses translated amino acid sequences to decipher functional protein like sequences. The nucleotide sequence-based initiation site recognition model has been trained using longer ORFs (>100 aa) in the same genome while the ML model for identification of protein like sequences has been trained using annotated smORFs from Escherichia coli. Comprehensive benchmarking of ProsmORF-pred reveals that its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches on the annotated smORF set derived from 32 prokaryotic genomes. Its performance is distinctly superior to other tools like PRODIGAL and RANSEPS for prediction of newly identified smORFs which have a length range of 10-30 aa, where prediction of smORFs has been a major challenge. Apart from identification of smORFs in genomic sequences, ProsmORF-pred can also aid in functional annotation of the predicted smORFs based on sequence similarity and genomic neighbourhood similarity searches in ProsmORFDB, a well-curated database of known smORFs. ProsmORF-pred along with its backend database ProsmORFDB is available as a user-friendly web server (http://www.nii.ac.in/prosmorfpred.html).",

However, the availability of significant amount of phospho-proteomics data during the last decade and advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms have opened up the opportunities for deciphering phosphorylation patterns of plasmodial system and developing ML-based phosphosite prediction tools for Plasmodium. We have developed Pf-Phospho, an ML-based method for prediction of phosphosites by training Random Forest classifiers using a large data set of 12 096 phosphosites of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium bergei. Of the 12 096 known phosphosites, 75% of sites have been used for training/validation of the classifier, while remaining 25% have been used as completely unseen test data for blind testing. It is encouraging to note that Pf-Phospho can predict the kinase-independent phosphosites with 84% sensitivity, 75% specificity and 78% precision. In addition, it can also predict kinase-specific phosphosites for five plasmodial kinases-PfPKG, Plasmodium falciparum, PfPKA, PfPK7 and PbCDPK4 with high accuracy. Pf-Phospho (http://www.nii.ac.in/pfphospho.html) outperforms other widely used phosphosite prediction tools, which have been trained using mammalian phosphoproteome data. It also has been integrated with other widely used resources such as PlasmoDB, MPMP, Pfam and recently available ML-based predicted structures by AlphaFold2. Currently, Pf-phospho is the only bioinformatics resource available for ML-based prediction of phospho-signaling networks of Plasmodium and is a user-friendly platform for integrative analysis of phospho-signaling along with metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks.",

PfCDPK1 belongs to CDPK family of apicomplexan kinases which have a C-terminal CAD domain. Microsecond scale MD simulations were performed on modeled structures of complete PfCDPK1 and its kinase domain alone. The simulations revealed that in absence of CAD the salt bridge between Glu116 in αC-helix and Lys85 in β3-sheet of kinase breaks after 200 ns resulting in inactive conformation of the kinase, but the salt bridge stays intact in the complete protein stabilizing it in active conformation. These results highlight the novel CAD mediated allosteric stabilization of the crucial salt bridge which is a hallmark of active conformation of kinase domains. The mechanistic details of the allosteric activation revealed by our study, opens up the possibility for design of allosteric inhibitors of PfCDPK1 kinase by disrupting the kinase:CAD interactions. Using a combination of machine learning and structure-based in silico screening, we have identified novel PPI modulators for allosteric inactivation of PfCDPK1 kinase.",

We have utilized a large data set of experimentally validated PPI modulators and developed machine learning classifiers for prediction of new small molecule modulators of PPI. Our analysis reveals that using random forest (RF) classifier, general PPI Modulators independent of PPI family can be predicted with ROC-AUC higher than 0.9, when training and test sets are generated by random split. The performance of the classifier on data sets very different from those used in training has also been estimated by using different state of the art protocols for removing various types of bias in division of data into training and test sets. The family-specific PPIM predictors developed in this work for 11 clinically important PPI families also have prediction accuracies of above 90% in majority of the cases. All these ML-based predictors have been implemented in a freely available software named SMMPPI for prediction of small molecule modulators for clinically relevant PPIs like RBD:hACE2, Bromodomain_Histone, BCL2-Like_BAX/BAK, LEDGF_IN, LFA_ICAM, MDM2-Like_P53, RAS_SOS1, XIAP_Smac, WDR5_MLL1, KEAP1_NRF2 and CD4_gp120. We have identified novel chemical scaffolds as inhibitors for RBD_hACE PPI involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Docking studies for some of the compounds reveal that they can inhibit RBD_hACE2 interaction by high affinity binding to interaction hotspots on RBD. Some of these new scaffolds have also been found in SARS-CoV-2 viral growth inhibitors reported recently; however, it is not known if these molecules inhibit the entry phase.",

Lack of algorithms for predicting complex macrocyclization patterns of linear PK/NRP biosynthetic intermediates has been the major bottleneck in deciphering the final bioactive chemical structures of PKs/NRPs by genome mining. RESULTS: Using a large dataset of known chemical structures of macrocyclized PKs/NRPs, we have developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm for distinguishing the correct macrocyclization pattern of PKs/NRPs from the library of all theoretically possible cyclization patterns. Benchmarking of this ML classifier on completely independent datasets has revealed ROC-AUC and PR-AUC values of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. This cyclization prediction algorithm has been used to develop SBSPKSv3, a genome mining tool for completely automated prediction of macrocyclized structures of NRPs/PKs. SBSPKSv3 has been extensively benchmarked on a dataset of over 100 BGCs with known PKs/NRPs products.

The extracytoplasmic domain interacts with mDAP-containing LipidII, and this is abolished upon mutation of the ligand-interacting residues. Abrogation of ligand-binding or sequestration of the ligand leads to aberrant localization of PknB. Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, abrogation of ligand-binding is linked to activation loop hyperphosphorylation, and indiscriminate hyperphosphorylation of PknB substrates as well as other proteins, ultimately causing loss of homeostasis and cell death. We propose that the ligand-kinase interaction directs the appropriate localization of the kinase, coupled to stringently controlled activation of PknB, and consequently the downstream processes thereof.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibody, the primary effector molecule of the immune system, evolves after initial encounter with the antigen from a precursor form to a mature one to effectively deal with the antigen. Antibodies of a lineage diverge through antigen-directed isolated pathways of maturation to exhibit distinct recognition potential. In the context of evolution in immune recognition, diversity of antigen cannot be ignored. While there are reports on antibody lineage, structural perspective with respect to diverse recognition potential in a lineage has never been studied. Hence, it is crucial to evaluate how maturation leads to topological tailoring within a lineage enabling them to interact with significantly distinct antigens. RESULTS: A data-driven approach was undertaken for the study. Global experimental mouse and human antibody-antigen complex structures from PDB were compiled into a coherent database of germline-linked antibodies bound with distinct antigens. Structural analysis of all lineages showed variations in CDRs of both H and L chains. Observations of conformational adaptation made from analysis of static structures were further evaluated by characterizing dynamics of interaction in two lineages, mouse V CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study highlight basic structural principles shaping the molecular evolution of a lineage for significantly diverse antigens. Antibodies of a lineage follow different developmental pathways while preserving the imprint of the germline. From the study, it can be generalized that structural diversification of the paratope is an outcome of natural selection of a conformation from an available ensemble, which is further optimized for antigen interaction. The study establishes that starting from a common lineage, antibodies can mature to recognize a wide range of antigens. This hypothesis can be further tested and validated experimentally.",

RiPPMiner uses Support Vector Machine to distinguish RiPP precursors from other small proteins and classify the precursors into 12 sub-classes of RiPPs. For classes like lanthipeptide, cyanobactin, lasso peptide and thiopeptide, RiPPMiner can predict leader cleavage site and complex cross-links between post-translationally modified residues starting from genome sequences. RiPPMiner can identify correct cross-link pattern in a core peptide from among a very large number of combinatorial possibilities. Benchmarking of prediction accuracy of RiPPMiner on a large lanthipeptide dataset indicated high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. RiPPMiner also provides interfaces for visualization of the chemical structure, downloading of simplified molecular-input line-entry system and searching for RiPPs having similar sequences or chemical structures. The backend database of RiPPMiner provides information about modification system, precursor sequence, leader and core sequence, modified residues, cross-links and gene cluster for more than 500 experimentally characterized RiPPs.

      "abstract": "LIN28 protein inhibits biogenesis of miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family by binding to precursor forms of miRNAs. Overexpression of LIN28 and low levels of let-7 miRNAs are associated with several forms of cancer cells. We have performed multiple explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations ranging from 200 to 500 ns in length on different isoforms of preE-let-7 in complex with LIN28 and also in isolation to identify structural features and key specificity-determining residues (SDRs) that are important for the inhibitory role of LIN28. Our simulations suggest that a conserved structural feature of the loop regions of preE-let-7 miRNAs is more important for LIN28 recognition than sequence conservation among members of the let-7 family or the presence of the GGAG motif in the 3' region. The loop region consisting of a minimum of five nucleotides helps pre-miRNAs to acquire a conformation ideal for binding to LIN28, but pre-let-7c-2 prefers a conformation with a three-nucleotide loop. Thus, our simulations provide a theoretical rationale for the recent experimental observation of the escape of LIN28-mediated repression by pre-let-7c-2. The essential structural and sequence features highlighted in this study might aid in designing synthetic small molecule inhibitors for modulating LIN28-let-7 interaction in malignant cells. We have also identified crucial SDRs of the LIN28-preE-let-7 complex involving 13 residues of LIN28 and 10 residues of the pre-miRNA. On the basis of the conservation profile of these 13 SDRs, we have identified 10 novel proteins that are not annotated as LIN28 like but are similar in sequence, domain, or fold level to LIN28.",

In this work, we have carried out both sequence- and structure-based analysis for crucial proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis, namely Dicer, Drosha, Argonaute (Ago), and Exportin-5 to understand evolution of these proteins in animal kingdom and also to identify key sequence and structural features that are determinants of their function. Our analysis reveals that in animals the miRNA biogenesis pathway first originated in molluscs. The phylogeny of Dicer and Ago indicated evolution through gene duplication followed by sequence divergence that resulted in functional divergence. Our detailed structural analysis also revealed that RIIIDb domains of Drosha and Dicer, share significant similarity in sequence, structure, and substrate-binding pocket. On the other hand, PAZ domains of Dicer and Ago show only conservation of the substrate-binding pockets in the catalytic sites despite significant divergence in sequence and overall structure. Based on a comparative structural analysis of all four human Ago proteins (hAgo1-4) and their known biochemical activity, we have also attempted to identify key residues in Ago2 which are responsible for the unique slicer activity of hAgo2 among all isoforms. We have identified six key residues in N domain of hAgo2, which are located far away from the catalytic pocket, but might be playing a major role in slicer activity of hAgo2 protein because of their involvement in mRNA binding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: PDZ domains recognize short sequence stretches usually present in C-terminal of their interaction partners. Because of the involvement of PDZ domains in many important biological processes, several attempts have been made for developing bioinformatics tools for genome-wide identification of PDZ interaction networks. Currently available tools for prediction of interaction partners of PDZ domains utilize machine learning approach. Since, they have been trained using experimental substrate specificity data for specific PDZ families, their applicability is limited to PDZ families closely related to the training set. These tools also do not allow analysis of PDZ-peptide interaction interfaces. RESULTS: We have used a structure based approach to develop modPDZpep, a program to predict the interaction partners of human PDZ domains and analyze structural details of PDZ interaction interfaces. modPDZpep predicts interaction partners by using structural models of PDZ-peptide complexes and evaluating binding energy scores using residue based statistical pair potentials. Since, it does not require training using experimental data on peptide binding affinity, it can predict substrates for diverse PDZ families. Because of the use of simple scoring function for binding energy, it is also fast enough for genome scale structure based analysis of PDZ interaction networks. Benchmarking using artificial as well as real negative datasets indicates good predictive power with ROC-AUC values in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 for a large number of human PDZ domains. Another novel feature of modPDZpep is its ability to map novel PDZ mediated interactions in human protein-protein interaction networks, either by utilizing available experimental phage display data or by structure based predictions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have developed modPDZpep, a web-server for structure based analysis of human PDZ domains.

      "abstract": "The Fic domain was recently shown to catalyze AMPylation-the transfer of AMP from ATP to hydroxyl side chains of diverse eukaryotic proteins, ranging from RhoGTPases to chaperon BiP. We have carried out a series of explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations up to 1 μs duration on the apo, holo, and substrate/product bound IbpA Fic domain (IbpAFic2). Simulations on holo-IbpAFic2 revealed that binding of Mg(2+) to α and β phosphates is crucial for preserving catalytically important contacts involving ATP. Comparative analysis of the MD trajectories demonstrated how binding of ATP allosterically induces conformational changes in the distal switch II binding region of Fic domains thereby aiding in substrate recognition. Our simulations have also identified crucial aromatic-aromatic interactions which stabilize the orientation of the catalytic histidine for inline nucleophilic attack during AMPylation, thus providing a structural basis for the evolutionary conservation of these aromatic residue pairs in Fic domains. On the basis of analysis of interacting interface residue pairs that persist over the microsecond trajectory, we identified a tetrapeptide stretch involved in substrate recognition. The structure-based genome-wide search revealed a distinct conservation pattern for this segment in different Fic subfamilies, further supporting its proposed role in substrate recognition. In addition, combined use of simulations and phylogenetic analysis has helped in the discovery of a new subfamily of Fic proteins that harbor a conserved Lys/Arg in place of the inhibitory Glu of the regulatory helix. We propose the novel possibility of auto-enhancement of AMPylation activity in this new subfamily via the movement of regulatory helix, in contrast to auto-inhibition seen in most Fic proteins.",

Involvement of these novel enzymes in a myriad of biological processes makes them interesting candidates for genome-wide search.

Our analysis has not only identified novel PTM catalyzing enzymes among unannotated proteins, but has also revealed how this novel enzyme family has evolved to generate functional diversity by subtle changes in sequence/structures of the proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of Fic/Doc has revealed three new isofunctional subfamilies, thus adding to their functional divergence. Also, frequent occurrence of Fic/Doc proteins on highly mobile and unstable genomic islands indicated their evolution via extensive horizontal gene transfers. On the other hand phylogenetic analyses indicate lateral evolution of GS-ATase family and an early duplication event responsible for AMPylation and deAMPylation activity of GS-ATase.

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and structural features of these known PTM catalyzing enzymes, we have created Hidden Markov Model profiles for the identification of similar PTM catalyzing enzymatic domains in genomic sequences. We have also created predictive rules for grouping them into functional subfamilies and deciphering their mechanistic details by structure-based analysis of their active site pockets. These analytical modules have been made available as user friendly search interfaces of novPTMenzy database. It also has a specialized analysis interface for some PTMs like AMPylation and Eliminylation.

Though there is experimental evidence for presence of dehydro amino acids in human proteins, no eukaryotic homologs of these lyases have been identified as of today. A comprehensive genome-wide search for identifying phosphothreonine lyase homologs in eukaryotes was carried out. Our fold-based search revealed structural and catalytic site similarity between bacterial phosphothreonine lyases and BLES03 (basophilic leukemia-expressed protein 03), a human protein with unknown function. Ligand induced conformational changes similar to bacterial phosphothreonine lyases, and movement of crucial arginines in the loop region to the catalytic pocket upon binding of phosphothreonine-containing peptides was seen during docking and molecular dynamics studies. Genome-wide search for BLES03 homologs using sensitive profile-based methods revealed their presence not only in eukaryotic classes such as chordata and fungi but also in bacterial and archaebacterial classes. The synteny of these archaebacterial BLES03-like proteins was remarkably similar to that of type IV lantibiotic synthetases which harbor LanL-like phosphothreonine lyase domains. Hence, context-based analysis reinforced our earlier sequence/structure-based prediction of phosphothreonine lyase catalytic function for BLES03. Our in silico analysis has revealed that BLES03-like proteins with previously unknown function are novel eukaryotic phosphothreonine lyases involved in biosynthesis of dehydro amino acids, whereas their bacterial and archaebacterial counterparts might be involved in biosynthesis of natural products similar to lantibiotics.",

      "abstract": "Mycobacterial Ser/Thr kinase, PknB, is essential for the growth of the pathogen. Unphosphorylated PknB is catalytically inactive, and its activation requires autophosphorylation of Thr residues on the activation loop. Autophosphorylation can in principle take place via two distinct mechanisms. Intermolecular trans autophosphorylation involves dimerization and phosphorylation of the activation loop of one chain in the catalytic pocket of the other chain. On the other hand, intramolecular cis autophosphorylation involves phosphorylation of the activation loop of the kinases in its own catalytic pocket within a monomer. On the basis of the crystal structure of PknB in the front-to-front dimeric form, it is currently believed that activation of PknB involves trans autophosphorylation. However, because of the lack of coordinates of the activation loop in the crystal structures, atomic details of the conformational changes associated with activation are yet to be deciphered. Therefore, to understand the conformational transitions associated with activation via autophosphorylation, a series of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations with a duration of 1 μs have been performed on each of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the PknB catalytic domain in monomeric and dimeric states. Simulations on phosphorylated PknB revealed a differential network of crucial electrostatic and hydrophobic residues that stabilize the phosphorylated form in the active conformation. Interestingly, in our simulations on nonphosphorylated monomers, the activation loop was observed to fold into its own active site, thereby opening the novel possibility of activation through intramolecular cis autophosphorylation. Thus, our simulations suggest that autophosphorylation of PknB might also involve cis initiation followed by trans amplification as reported for other eukaryotic kinases based on recent reaction kinetics studies.",

Even though experimental studies have reported characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors of PDZ-peptide interactions, the binding modes for most of them have not been characterized by structural studies. In this study we have attempted to understand the structural basis of the small molecule-PDZ interactions by in silico analysis of the binding modes and binding affinities of a set of 38 small molecules with known K(i) or K(d) values for PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains of PSD-95 protein. These two PDZ domains show differential selectivity for these compounds despite having a high degree of sequence similarity and almost identical peptide binding pockets. Optimum binding modes for these ligands for PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains were identified by using a novel combination of semi-flexible docking and explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Analysis of the binding modes revealed most of the peptidomimectic ligands which had high K(i) or K(d) moved away from the peptide binding pocket, while ligands with high binding affinities remained in the peptide binding pocket. The differential specificities of the PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains primarily arise from differences in the conformation of the loop connecting βB and βC strands, because this loop interacts with the N-terminal chemical moieties of the ligands. We have also computed the MM/PBSA binding free energy values for these 38 compounds with both the PDZ domains from multiple 5 ns MD trajectories on each complex i.e. a total of 228 MD trajectories of 5 ns length each. Interestingly, computational binding free energies show good agreement with experimental binding free energies with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.6. Thus our study demonstrates that combined use of docking and MD simulations can help in identification of potent inhibitors of PDZ-peptide complexes.",

The specificity of interactions between various catalytic domains of these megasynthases is one of the pivotal factors which control the precise order in which the extender units are joined during the biosynthetic process. Hence, understanding the molecular details of protein-protein interactions in the PKS megasynthases would be crucial for rational design of novel polyketides by domain swapping experiments involving engineered combinations of PKS catalytic domains. We have developed a computational method for exploring the binding interface between two proteins, and used it to identify the interacting residue pairs, which govern the specificity of recognition between acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain and two core catalytic domains, namely the ketosynthase (KS) and acyl transferase (AT). Both of these domain interactions i.e. the KS-ACP and the AT-ACP, are likely to play a major role in channelling of substrates and control of specificity during polyketide biosynthesis. The method, called interface scan, uses a combination of geometric docking and evolutionary information for the identification of the most appropriate mode of association between two proteins. The parameters of interface scan have been standardized based on analysis of contacts in the crystal structure of ACP in complex with ACP synthase (AcpS). Many of the contacts predicted for PKS domains are in agreement with available experiments.",

GPLs from Mycobacterium smegmatis are composed of a lipopeptide core unit consisting of a modified C(26)-C(34) fatty acyl chain that is linked to a tetrapeptide (Phe-Thr-Ala-alaninol). The hydroxyl groups of threonine and terminal alaninol are further modified by glycosylations. Although chemical structures have been reported for 16 GPLs from diverse mycobacteria, there is still ambiguity in identifying the exact position of the hydroxyl group on the fatty acyl chain. Moreover, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the fatty acyl component are unknown. In this study we show that a bimodular polyketide synthase in conjunction with a fatty acyl-AMP ligase dictates the synthesis of fatty acyl chain of GPL. Based on genetic, biochemical, and structural investigations, we determine that the hydroxyl group is present at the C-5 position of the fatty acyl component. Our retrobiosynthetic approach has provided a means to understand the biosynthesis of GPLs and also resolve the long-standing debate on the accurate structure of mycobacterial GPLs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modular polyketide synthases are multifunctional megasynthases which biosynthesize a variety of secondary metabolites using various combinations of dehydratase (DH), ketoreductase (KR) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. During the catalysis of various reductive steps these domains act on a substrate moiety which is covalently attached to the phosphopantetheine (P-pant) group of the holo-Acyl Carrier Protein (holo-ACP) domain, thus necessitating the formation of holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes. Even though three dimensional structures are available for DH, KR and ACP domains, no structures are available for DH or KR domains in complex with ACP or substrate moieties. Since Ser of holo-ACP is covalently attached to a large phosphopantetheine group, obtaining complexes involving holo-ACP by standard protein-protein docking has been a difficult task. RESULTS: We have modeled the holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes for identifying specific residues on DH and KR domains which are involved in interaction with ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety. A novel combination of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking has been used to first model complexes involving apo-ACP and then dock the phosphopantetheine and substrate moieties using covalent connectivity between ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety as constraints. The holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes obtained from docking have been further refined by restraint free explicit solvent MD simulations to incorporate effects of ligand and receptor flexibilities. The results from 50 ns MD simulations reveal that substrate enters into a deep tunnel in DH domain while in case of KR domain the substrate binds a shallow surface exposed cavity. Interestingly, in case of DH domain the predicted binding site overlapped with the binding site in the inhibitor bound crystal structure of FabZ, the DH domain from E.Coli FAS. In case of KR domain, the substrate binding site identified by our simulations was in proximity of the known stereo-specificity determining residues. CONCLUSIONS: We have modeled the holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes and identified the specific residues on DH and KR domains which are involved in interaction with ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety. Analysis of the conservation profile of binding pocket residues in homologous sequences of DH and KR domains indicated that, these results can also be extrapolated to reductive domains of other modular PKS clusters.",

Despite recently reported crystal structures of Toxoplasma gondii (Tg)CDPKs, several important questions about their regulation remain unanswered. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)CDPK1 has emerged as a key player in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, as it may be involved in the invasion of the host cells. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies on PfCDPK1 suggested that several residues in the regulatory domain play a dual role, as they seem to contribute to the stabilization of both the active and inactive kinase. Mass spectrometry revealed that PfCDPK1 was autophosphorylated at several sites; some of these were placed at strategic locations and therefore were found to be critical for kinase activation. The N-terminal extension of PfCDPK1 was found to be important for PfCDPK1 activation. Unexpectedly, an ATP binding site in the NTE of PfCDPK1 was identified. Our studies highlight several novel features of PfCDPK1 regulation, which may be shared by other members of the CDPK family. These findings may also aid design of inhibitors against these important targets, which are absent from the host.",

The enhanced sensitivity of cells from RTS patients correlates with the accumulation of transcriptionally active nuclear p53. We found that in untreated normal human cells these two nuclear proteins, p53 and RECQL4, instead colocalize in the mitochondrial nucleoids. RECQL4 accumulates in mitochondria in all phases of the cell cycle except S phase and physically interacts with p53 only in the absence of DNA damage. p53-RECQL4 binding leads to the masking of the nuclear localization signal of p53. The N-terminal 84 amino acids of RECQL4 contain a mitochondrial localization signal, which causes the localization of RECQL4-p53 complex to the mitochondria. RECQL4-p53 interaction is disrupted after stress, allowing p53 translocation to the nucleus. In untreated normal cells RECQL4 optimizes de novo replication of mtDNA, which is consequently decreased in fibroblasts from RTS patients. Wild-type RECQL4-complemented RTS cells show relocalization of both RECQL4 and p53 to the mitochondria, loss of p53 activation, restoration of de novo mtDNA replication and resistance to different types of DNA damage. In cells expressing Δ84 RECQL4, which cannot translocate to mitochondria, all the above functions are compromised. The recruitment of p53 to the sites of de novo mtDNA replication is also regulated by RECQL4. Thus these findings elucidate the mechanism by which p53 is regulated by RECQL4 in unstressed normal cells and also delineates the mitochondrial functions of the helicase.",

In order to understand the role of disulfide bonds and glycosylation on the structure and function of PMP-C, we have carried out multiple explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on fucosylated and non-fucosylated forms of PMP-C, both in the presence and absence of the disulfide bonds. Our simulations revealed that there were no significant structural changes in the native disulfide bonded forms of PMP-C due to fucosylation. On the other hand, the non-fucosylated form of PMP-C without disulfide bonds showed larger deviations from the starting structure than the fucosylated form. However, the structural deviations were restricted to the terminal regions while core β-sheet retained its hydrogen bonded structure even in absence of disulfide bonds as well as fucosylation. Interestingly, fucosylation of disulfide bonded native PMP-C led to a decreased thermal flexibility in the residue stretch 29-32 which is known to interact with the active site of the target proteases. Our analysis revealed that disulfide bonds covalently connect the residue stretch 29-32 to the central β-sheet of PMP-C and using a novel network of side chain interactions and disulfide bonds fucosylation at Thr 9 is altering the flexibility of the stretch 29-32 located at a distal site. Thus, our simulations explain for the first time, how presence of disulfide bonds between conserved cysteines and fucosylation enhance the function of PMP-C as a protease inhibitor.",

The crystal structures of the KS-AT di-domain from erythromycin synthase have revealed the relative orientation of various catalytic domains in a minimal PKS module. However, the relatively large distance between catalytic centers of KS and AT domains in the static structure has posed certain intriguing questions regarding mechanistic details of substrate transfer during polyketide biosynthesis. In order to investigate the role of inter-domain movements in substrate channeling, we have carried out a series of explicit solvent MD simulations for time periods ranging from 10 to 15 ns on the KS-AT di-domain and its sub-fragments. Analyses of these MD trajectories have revealed that both the catalytic domains and the structured inter-domain linker region remain close to their starting structures. Inter-domain movements at KS-linker and linker-AT interfaces occur around hinge regions which connect the structured linker region to the catalytic domains. The KS-linker interface was found to be more flexible compared to the linker-AT interface. However, inter-domain movements observed during the timescale of our simulations do not significantly reduce the distance between catalytic centers of KS and AT domains for facilitating substrate channeling. Based on these studies and prediction of intrinsic disorder we propose that the intrinsically unstructured linker stretch preceding the ACP domain might be facilitating movement of ACP domains to various catalytic centers.",

Genome sequencing studies have revealed a remarkable array of genes homologous to polyketide synthases (PKSs) that are known to synthesize secondary metabolites in bacteria and fungi. A crucial step in functional activation of PKSs involves their post-translational modification catalyzed by phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases). PPTases have been recently characterized from several bacteria; however, their relevance in complex life cycle of protozoa remains largely unexplored. Here we have identified and characterized two phosphopantetheinyl transferases from D. discoideum that exhibit distinct functional specificity. DiAcpS specifically modifies a stand-alone acyl carrier protein (ACP) that possesses a mitochondrial import signal. DiSfp in contrast is specific to Type I multifunctional PKS/fatty acid synthase proteins and cannot modify the stand-alone ACP. The mRNA of two PPTases can be detected during the vegetative as well as starvation-induced developmental pathway and the disruption of either of these genes results in non-viable amoebae. Our studies show that both PPTases play an important role in Dictyostelium biology and provide insight into the importance of PPTases in lower eukaryotes.",

Mechanistic and structural studies with FAALs suggest that this group of proteins may have evolved from omnipresent fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs). FAALs activate fatty acids as acyl-adenylates and transfer them on to the PKSs which then produce unusual acyl chains that are the components of mycobacterial lipids. FAALs are a newly discovered family of enzymes; whereas involvement of PKSs in lipid metabolism was not known prior to their discovery in Mtb. Since Mtb genome contains multiple homologs of FAALs and PKSs and owing to the conserved reaction mechanism and overlapping substrate specificity; there is tempting opportunity to develop 'systemic drugs' against these enzymes as anti-tuberculosis agents.",

Our results indicate that, despite the similarity in overall three dimensional structures, glycosylated EcorL has lesser nonpolar solvent accessible surface area compared to nonglycosylated EcorL. This might explain the experimental observation of higher thermodynamic stability for glycosylated EcorL compared to nonglycosylated EcorL. Analysis of the simulation results indicates that, dynamic view of interactions between protein residues and oligosaccharide is entirely different from the static picture seen in the crystal structure. The oligosaccharide moiety had dynamically stable interactions with Lys 55 and Tyr 53, both of which are separated in sequence from the site of glycosylation, Asn 17. It is possible that glycosylation helps in forming long-range contacts between amino acids, which are separated in sequence and thus provides a folding nucleus. Thus our simulations not only reveal the conformations sampled by the oligosaccharide, but also provide novel insights into possible molecular mechanisms by which glycosylation can help in folding of the glycoprotein by formation of folding nucleus involving specific contacts with the oligosaccharide moiety.",

However, most of the prediction methods use motifs/profiles derived from experimental peptide binding data for specific MHC alleles, thus limiting their applicability only to those alleles for which such data is available. In this work we have developed a structure-based method which does not require experimental peptide binding data for training. Our method models MHC-peptide complexes using crystal structures of 170 MHC-peptide complexes and evaluates the binding energies using two well known residue based statistical pair potentials, namely Betancourt-Thirumalai (BT) and Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) matrices. Extensive benchmarking of prediction accuracy on a data set of 1654 epitopes from class I and class II alleles available in the SYFPEITHI database indicate that BT pair-potential can predict more than 60% of the known binders in case of 14 MHC alleles with AUC values for ROC curves ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Similar benchmarking on 29,522 class I and class II MHC binding peptides with known IC(50) values in the IEDB database showed AUC values higher than 0.6 for 10 class I alleles and 9 class II alleles in predictions involving classification of a peptide to be binder or non-binder. Comparison with recently available benchmarking studies indicated that, the prediction accuracy of our method for many of the class I and class II MHC alleles was comparable to the sequence based methods, even if it does not use any experimental data for training. It is also encouraging to note that the ranks of true binding peptides could further be improved, when high scoring peptides obtained from pair potential were re-ranked using all atom forcefield and MM/PBSA method.",

      "abstract": "BLM helicase, the protein mutated in Bloom syndrome, is involved in signal transduction cascades after DNA damage. BLM is phosphorylated on multiple residues by different kinases either after stress induction or during mitosis. Here, we have provided evidence that both Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylated the NH(2)-terminal 660 amino acids of BLM. An internal region within the DExH motif of BLM negatively regulated the Chk1/Chk2-dependent NH(2)-terminal phosphorylation event. Using in silico analysis involving the Chk1 structure and its known substrate specificity, we predicted that Chk1 should preferentially phosphorylate BLM on serine 646 (Ser(646)). The prediction was validated in vitro by phosphopeptide analysis on BLM mutants and in vivo by usage of a newly generated phosphospecific polyclonal antibody. We showed that the phosphorylation at Ser(646) on BLM was constitutive and decreased rapidly after exposure to DNA damage. This resulted in the diminished interaction of BLM with nucleolin and PML isoforms, and consequently decreased BLM accumulation in the nucleolus and PML nuclear bodies. Instead, BLM relocalized to the sites of DNA damage and bound with the damage sensor protein, Nbs1. Mutant analysis confirmed that the binding to nucleolin and PML isoforms required Ser(646) phosphorylation. These results indicated that Chk1-mediated phosphorylation on BLM at Ser(646) might be a determinant for regulating subnuclear localization and could act as a marker for the activation status of BLM in response to DNA damage.",

The availability of the crystal structures of various PKS catalytic and docking domains, and mammalian fatty acid synthase module prompted us to develop SBSPKS software which consists of three major components. Model_3D_PKS can be used for modeling, visualization and analysis of 3D structure of individual PKS catalytic domains, dimeric structures for complete PKS modules and prediction of substrate specificity. Dock_Dom_Anal identifies the key interacting residue pairs in inter-subunit interfaces based on alignment of inter-polypeptide linker sequences to the docking domain structure. In case of modular PKS with multiple open reading frames (ORFs), it can predict the cognate order of substrate channeling based on combinatorial evaluation of all possible interface contacts. NRPS-PKS provides user friendly tools for identifying various catalytic domains in the sequence of a Type I PKS protein and comparing them with experimentally characterized PKS/NRPS clusters cataloged in the backend databases of SBSPKS.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enzymes belonging to acyl:CoA synthetase (ACS) superfamily activate wide variety of substrates and play major role in increasing the structural and functional diversity of various secondary metabolites in microbes and plants. However, due to the large sequence divergence within the superfamily, it is difficult to predict their substrate preference by annotation transfer from the closest homolog. Therefore, a large number of ACS sequences present in public databases lack any functional annotation at the level of substrate specificity. Recently, several examples have been reported where the enzymes showing high sequence similarity to luciferases or coumarate:CoA ligases have been surprisingly found to activate fatty acyl substrates in experimental studies. In this work, we have investigated the relationship between the substrate specificity of ACS and their sequence/structural features, and developed a novel computational protocol for in silico assignment of substrate preference. RESULTS: We have used a knowledge-based approach which involves compilation of substrate specificity information for various experimentally characterized ACS and derivation of profile HMMs for each subfamily. These HMM profiles can accurately differentiate probable cognate substrates from non-cognate possibilities with high specificity (Sp) and sensitivity (Sn) (Sn = 0.91-1.0, Sp = 0.96-1.0) values. Using homologous crystal structures, we identified a limited number of contact residues crucial for substrate recognition i.e. specificity determining residues (SDRs). Patterns of SDRs from different subfamilies have been used to derive predictive rules for correlating them to substrate preference. The power of the SDR approach has been demonstrated by correct prediction of substrates for enzymes which show apparently anomalous substrate preference. Furthermore, molecular modeling of the substrates in the active site has been carried out to understand the structural basis of substrate selection. A web based prediction tool http://www.nii.res.in/pred_acs_substr.html has been developed for automated functional classification of ACS enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel computational protocol for predicting substrate preference for ACS superfamily of enzymes using a limited number of SDRs. Using this approach substrate preference can be assigned to a large number of ACS enzymes present in various genomes. It can potentially help in rational design of novel proteins with altered substrate specificities.",

This prompted us to develop a novel multi-scale structure-based approach which does not require training using experimental substrate data. RESULTS: In this work, for the first time, we have used residue-based statistical pair potentials for scoring the binding energy of various substrate peptides in complex with kinases. Extensive benchmarking on Phospho.ELM data set indicate that our method outperforms other structure-based methods and has a prediction accuracy comparable to available sequence-based methods. We also demonstrate that the rank of the true substrate can be further improved, if the high-scoring candidate substrates that are short-listed based on pair potential score, are modeled using all atom forcefield and MM/PBSA approach.

Strikingly, the existing programs were not successful in detecting the known consensus in all mycobacterial (epitomizing degenerate) datasets even in the absence of noise and their performance was further reduced in the presence of noise. Consequently, MoPP, a de novo and greedy (for degeneracy) 'inexact' word-based tool that is tailored to enumerate significantly conserved degenerate oligonucleotide motifs was developed. Benchmarking on datasets from MycoRegDB and SCPD (http://rulai.cshl.edu/SCPD/) indicate that MoPP (i) consistently outperforms other motif discovery tools on highly degenerate as well as less degenerate datasets and (ii) successfully detects completely degenerate motifs (with no two instances of a pattern being exactly the same) even in the presence of noise. We have also developed another accessory program, MyPatternFinder, that scans a given sequence or genome to find exact or approximate matches to a query motif of any length identified by MoPP or any other user-defined motif.

PKSs are huge multifunctional megasynthases that use a variety of biosynthetic paradigms to generate enormously diverse arrays of polyketide products that posses several pharmaceutically important properties. The remarkable conservation of these gene clusters across organisms offers abundant scope for obtaining novel insights into PKS biosynthetic code by computational analysis. We have carried out a comprehensive in silico analysis of modular and iterative gene clusters to test whether chemical structures of the secondary metabolites can be predicted from PKS protein sequences. Here, we report the success of our method and demonstrate the feasibility of deciphering the putative metabolic products of uncharacterized PKS clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. Profile Hidden Markov Model analysis has revealed distinct sequence features that can distinguish modular PKS proteins from their iterative counterparts. For iterative PKS proteins, structural models of iterative ketosynthase (KS) domains have revealed novel correlations between the size of the polyketide products and volume of the active site pocket. Furthermore, we have identified key residues in the substrate binding pocket that control the number of chain extensions in iterative PKSs. For modular PKS proteins, we describe for the first time an automated method based on crucial intermolecular contacts that can distinguish the correct biosynthetic order of substrate channeling from a large number of non-cognate combinatorial possibilities. Taken together, our in silico analysis provides valuable clues for formulating rules for predicting polyketide products of iterative as well as modular PKS clusters.

Presently, it is not evident how obligate pathogens such as Mtb have evolved such new themes of functional versatility and whether the activation of fatty acids to acyladenylates could indeed be a general mechanism. Here, based on elucidation of the first structure of an FAAL protein and by generating loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants that interconvert FAAL and FACL activities, we demonstrate that an insertion motif dictates formation of acyladenylate.

A number of different tailoring enzymes catalyze a variety of chemical modifications to the polyketide or nonribosomal peptide backbone of these secondary metabolites to enhance their structural diversity. Therefore, development of powerful bioinformatics methods for identification of these tailoring enzymes and assignment of their substrate specificity is crucial for deciphering novel secondary metabolites by genome mining. RESULTS: In this work, we have carried out a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of methyltransferase (MT) domains present in multi functional type I PKS and NRPS proteins encoded by PKS/NRPS gene clusters having known secondary metabolite products. Based on the results of this analysis, we have developed a novel knowledge based computational approach for detecting MT domains present in PKS and NRPS megasynthases, delineating their correct boundaries and classifying them as N-MT, C-MT and O-MT using profile HMMs. Analysis of proteins in nr database of NCBI using these class specific profiles has revealed several interesting examples, namely, C-MT domains in NRPS modules, N-MT domains with significant homology to C-MT proteins, and presence of NRPS/PKS MTs in association with other catalytic domains. Our analysis of the chemical structures of the secondary metabolites and their site of methylation suggested that a possible evolutionary basis for the presence of a novel class of N-MT domains with significant homology to C-MT proteins could be the close resemblance of the chemical structures of the acceptor substrates, as in the case of pyochelin and yersiniabactin. These two classes of MTs recognize similar acceptor substrates, but transfer methyl groups to N and C positions on these substrates. CONCLUSION: We have developed a novel knowledge based computational approach for identifying MT domains present in type I PKS and NRPS multifunctional enzymes and predicting their site of methylation. Analysis of nr database using this approach has revealed presence of several novel MT domains. Our analysis has also given interesting insight into the evolutionary basis of the novel substrate specificities of these MT proteins.",

Even though metal ions are known to control the sugar binding ability of legume lectins, the interplay between sugar and metal ion binding to ConA has not been elucidated in a detailed manner at the atomic level. We have carried out long, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations for tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric forms of ConA in both the presence and absence of trimannoside and metal ions. Detailed analyses of these trajectories for various oligomeric forms under different environmental conditions have revealed dynamic conformational changes associated with the demetalization of ConA. We found that demetalization of ConA leads to large conformational changes in the ion binding loop, with some of the loop residues moving as far as 17 A with respect to their positions in the native trimannoside and metal ion-bound crystal structure. However, the ?-sheet core of the protein remains relatively unperturbed. In addition, the high mobility of the ion binding loop results in drifting of the substrates in the absence of bound metal ions. These simulations provide a theoretical rationale for previous experimental observations regarding the abolition of the sugar binding ability upon demetalization. We also found that the amino acid stretches of ConA, having high B-factor values in the crystal structure, show relatively greater mobility in the simulations. The overall agreement of the results of our simulations with various experimental studies suggests that the force field parameters and length of simulations used in our study are adequate to mimic the dynamic structural changes in the ConA protein.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable versatility of polyketide synthases (PKSs) has been recognized; both in terms of their structural and functional organization as well as their ability to produce compounds other than typical secondary metabolites. Multifunctional Type I PKSs catalyze the biosynthesis of polyketide products by either using the same active sites repetitively (iterative) or by using these catalytic domains only once (modular) during the entire biosynthetic process. The largest open reading frame in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pks12, was recently proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of mannosyl-beta-1-phosphomycoketide (MPM). The PKS12 protein contains two complete sets of modules and has been suggested to synthesize mycoketide by five alternating condensations of methylmalonyl and malonyl units by using an iterative mode of catalysis. The bimodular iterative catalysis would require transfer of intermediate chains from acyl carrier protein domain of module 2 to ketosynthase domain of module 1. Such bimodular iterations during PKS biosynthesis have not been characterized and appear unlikely based on recent understanding of the three-dimensional organization of these proteins. Moreover, all known examples of iterative PKSs so far characterized involve unimodular iterations. Based on cell-free reconstitution of PKS12 enzymatic machinery, in this study, we provide the first evidence for a novel \"modularly iterative\" mechanism of biosynthesis. By combination of biochemical, computational, mutagenic, analytical ultracentrifugation and atomic force microscopy studies, we propose that PKS12 protein is organized as a large supramolecular assembly mediated through specific interactions between the C- and N-terminus linkers. PKS12 protein thus forms a modular assembly to perform repetitive condensations analogous to iterative proteins. This novel intermolecular iterative biosynthetic mechanism provides new perspective to our understanding of polyketide biosynthetic machinery and also suggests new ways to engineer polyketide metabolites. The characterization of novel molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of mycobacterial virulent lipids has opened new avenues for drug discovery.",

However, the functional relevance of these proteins in the biology of this organism remains largely obscure. On the basis of computational, biochemical, and gene expression studies, we propose that the multifunctional Dictyostelium PKS (DiPKS) protein DiPKS1 could be involved in the biosynthesis of the differentiation regulating factor 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (MPBD). Our cell-free reconstitution studies of a novel acyl carrier protein Type III PKS didomain from DiPKS1 revealed a crucial role of protein-protein interactions in determining the final biosynthetic product. Whereas the Type III PKS domain by itself primarily produces acyl pyrones, the presence of the interacting acyl carrier protein domain modulates the catalytic activity to produce the alkyl resorcinol scaffold of MPBD. Furthermore, we have characterized an O-methyltransferase (OMT12) from Dictyostelium with the capability to modify this resorcinol ring to synthesize a variant of MPBD. We propose that such a modification in vivo could in fact provide subtle variations in biological function and specificity. In addition, we have performed systematic computational analysis of 45 multidomain PKSs, which revealed several unique features in DiPKS proteins. Our studies provide a new perspective in understanding mechanisms by which metabolic diversity could be generated by combining existing functional scaffolds.",

Here, we report a biosynthetic locus that incorporates variety of aliphatic chains on the mycobactin skeleton. Cell-free reconstitution studies demonstrate that these acyl chains are directly transferred from a carrier protein on to the epsilon-amino group of lysine residue by an unidentified Rv1347c gene product. The unsaturation in the lipidic chain is produced by a novel acyl-acyl carrier protein dehydrogenase, which, in contrast to the conventional acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, is involved in the biosynthetic pathway.

The genetic reconstitution necessitates that the heterologous hosts possess substrate pools that could be coordinately supplied for biosynthesis. Polyketide synthases (PKS) utilize acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) precursors and synthesize polyketides by repetitive decarboxylative condensations. Here we show that acyl-CoA ligases, which belong to a large family of acyl-activating enzymes, possess potential to produce varied starter CoA precursors that could be utilized in polyketide biosynthesis. Incidentally, such protein domains have been recognized in several PKS and nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters. Our studies with mycobacterial fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs) show remarkable tolerance to activate a variety of fatty acids that contain modifications at alpha, beta, omega, and omega-nu positions. This substrate flexibility extends further such that these proteins also efficiently utilize N-acetyl cysteamine, the shorter acceptor terminal portion of CoASH, to produce acyl-SNACs. We show that the in situ generated acyl-CoAs and acyl-SNACs could be channeled to types I and -III PKS systems to produce new metabolites. Together, the promiscuous activity of FACL and PKSs provides new opportunities to expand the repertoire of natural products.",

The results of these analyses have been organized as four integrated searchable databases for elucidating domain organization and substrate specificity of nonribosomal peptide synthetases and three types of polyketide synthases. These databases work as the backend of NRPS-PKS and provide the knowledge base for predicting domain organization and substrate specificity of uncharacterized NRPS/PKS clusters.

These features of NRPS-PKS make it a valuable resource for identification of natural products biosynthesized by NRPS/PKS gene clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. The training and test sets of gene clusters included in NRPS-PKS correlate information on 307 open reading frames, 2223 functional protein domains, 68 starter/extender precursors and their specific recognition motifs, and also the chemical structure of 101 natural products from four different families.

In mycobacteria, several unique complex lipids are produced by the combined action of fatty acid synthases and polyketide synthases (PKSs), although it is not clear how the covalently sequestered biosynthetic intermediates are transferred from one enzymatic complex to another. Here we show that some of the 36 annotated fadD genes, located adjacent to the PKS genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, constitute a new class of long-chain fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs). These proteins activate long-chain fatty acids as acyl-adenylates, which are then transferred to the multifunctional PKSs for further chain extension. This mode of activation and transfer of fatty acids is contrary to the previously described universal mechanism involving the formation of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters. Similar mechanisms may operate in the biosynthesis of other lipid-containing metabolites and could have implications in engineering novel hybrid products.",

      "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome has revealed a remarkable array of polyketide synthases (PKSs); however, no polyketide product has been isolated thus far. Most of the PKS genes have been implicated in the biosynthesis of complex lipids. We report here the characterization of two novel type III PKSs from M. tuberculosis that are involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain alpha-pyrones. Measurement of steady-state kinetic parameters demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of PKS18 protein was severalfold higher for long-chain acyl-coenzyme A substrates as compared with the small-chain precursors. The specificity of PKS18 and PKS11 proteins toward long-chain aliphatic acyl-coenzyme A (C12 to C20) substrates is unprecedented in the chalcone synthase (CHS) family of condensing enzymes. Based on comparative modeling studies, we propose that these proteins might have evolved by fusing the catalytic machinery of CHS and beta-ketoacyl synthases, the two evolutionarily related members with conserved thiolase fold. The mechanistic and structural importance of several active site residues, as predicted by our structural model, was investigated by performing site-directed mutagenesis. The functional identification of diverse catalytic activity in mycobacterial type III PKSs provide a fascinating example of metabolite divergence in CHS-like proteins.",

Modular polyketide synthases are unusually large multi-enzymatic multi-domain megasynthases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important natural products using an assembly-line mechanism. This program facilitates easy identification of various PKS domains and modules from a given polypeptide sequence. In addition, it also predicts the specificity of the potential acyltransferase domains for various starter and extender precursor units. SEARCHPKS is a user-friendly tool for correlating polyketide chemical structures with the organization of domains and modules in the corresponding modular polyketide synthases. This program also allows the user to extensively analyze and assess the sequence homology of various polyketide synthase domains, thus providing guidelines for carrying out domain and module swapping experiments. SEARCHPKS can also aid in identification of polyketide products made by PKS clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. The computational approach used in SEARCHPKS is based on a comprehensive analysis of various characterized clusters of modular polyketide synthases compiled in PKSDB, a database of modular polyketide synthases.

      "abstract": "Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large multi-enzymatic, multi-domain megasynthases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of a class of pharmaceutically important natural products, namely polyketides. These enzymes harbor a set of repetitive active sites termed modules and the domains present in each module dictate the chemical moiety that would add to a growing polyketide chain. This modular logic of biosynthesis has been exploited with reasonable success to produce several novel compounds by genetic manipulation. However, for harnessing their vast potential of combinatorial biosynthesis, it is essential to develop knowledge based in silico approaches for correlating the sequence and domain organization of PKSs to their polyketide products. In this work, we have carried out extensive sequence analysis of experimentally characterized PKS clusters to develop an automated computational protocol for unambiguous identification of various PKS domains in a polypeptide sequence. A structure based approach has been used to identify the putative active site residues of acyltransferase (AT) domains, which control the specificities for various starter and extender units during polyketide biosynthesis. On the basis of the analysis of the active site residues and molecular modelling of substrates in the active site of representative AT domains, we have identified a crucial residue that is likely to play a major role in discriminating between malonate and methylmalonate during selection of extender groups by this domain. Structural modelling has also explained the experimentally observed chiral preference of AT domain in substrate selection. This computational protocol has been used to predict the domain organization and substrate specificity for PKS clusters from various microbial genomes. The results of our analysis as well as the computational tools for prediction of domain organization and substrate specificity have been organized in the form of a searchable computerized database (PKSDB). PKSDB would serve as a valuable tool for identification of polyketide products biosynthesized by uncharacterized PKS clusters. This database can also provide guidelines for rational design of experiments to engineer novel polyketides.",
