      "abstract": "Ki-67 and RepoMan have key roles during mitotic exit. Previously, we showed that Ki-67 organizes the mitotic chromosome periphery and recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin at anaphase onset, in a similar manner as RepoMan (Booth et al., 2014). Here we show how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases by recruiting PP1, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes are dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis. Unexpectedly, our data also reveal that Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical, yet novel mechanism, interacting with a PP1 pocket that is engaged only by these two PP1 regulators. These findings not only show how two distinct mitotic exit phosphatases are recruited to their substrates, but also provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel cancer therapeutics that selectively target the Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzymes.",

      "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases, which include p38, are essential for cell differentiation and autophagy. The current model for p38 activation involves activation-loop phosphorylation with subsequent substrate binding leading to substrate phosphorylation. Despite extensive efforts, the molecular mechanism of activation remains unclear. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we show how the modulation of protein dynamics across timescales activates p38. We find that activation-loop phosphorylation does not change the average conformation of p38; rather it quenches the loop ps-ns dynamics. We then show that substrate binding to nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated p38 results in uniform µs-ms backbone dynamics at catalytically essential regions and across the entire molecule, respectively. Together, these results show that phosphorylation and substrate binding flatten the energy landscape of the protein, making essential elements of allostery and activation dynamically accessible. The high degree of structural conservation among ser/thr kinases suggests that elements of this mechanism may be conserved across the kinase family.",

The enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating GYS and phosphorylase, which results in their activation (GYS) or inactivation (phosphorylase) to robustly stimulate glycogen synthesis, is protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). However, our understanding of how PP1 recruits these substrates is limited. Here, we show how PP1, together with its muscle glycogen-targeting (GM) regulatory subunit, recruits and selectively dephosphorylates its substrates. Our molecular data reveal that the GM carbohydrate binding module (GM CBM21), which is amino-terminal to the GM PP1 binding domain, has a dual function in directing PP1 substrate specificity: It either directly recruits substrates (i.e., GYS) or recruits them indirectly by localization (via glycogen for phosphorylase). Our data provide the molecular basis for PP1 regulation by GM and reveal how PP1-mediated dephosphorylation is driven by scaffolding-based substrate recruitment.",

The human genome consists of more than 200,000 phosphorylation sites, whose phosphorylation is tightly controlled by ≥500 kinases and ~200 phosphatases. Given the large number of phosphorylation sites and the key role phosphorylation plays in regulating cellular processes, it is essential to characterize the impact of phosphorylation on substrate structure, dynamics, and function. However, a major challenge is the large-scale production of phosphorylated proteins in vitro for these structural, functional, and dynamic studies. Here, we describe an efficient protocol used routinely in our laboratory for the production of phosphorylated proteins. We also describe the methods used for identifying, characterizing, and separating the resulting phosphorylated proteins for subsequent studies.",

The tumour suppressor ASPP (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53) proteins associate with PP1 catalytic subunits and are implicated in multiple functions from transcriptional regulation to cell junction remodelling. Here we show that Drosophila ASPP is part of a multiprotein PP1 complex and that PP1 association is necessary for several in vivo functions of Drosophila ASPP. We solve the crystal structure of the human ASPP2/PP1 complex and show that ASPP2 recruits PP1 using both its canonical RVxF motif, which binds the PP1 catalytic domain, and its SH3 domain, which engages the PP1 C-terminal tail. The ASPP2 SH3 domain can discriminate between PP1 isoforms using an acidic specificity pocket in the n-Src domain, providing an exquisite mechanism where multiple motifs are used combinatorially to tune binding affinity to PP1.",

While much has been learned about MAPK activation, much less is known about substrate recruitment and specificity. MAPK substrates may be other kinases that are crucial to promote a further diversification of the signaling outcomes. Here, we used a variety of molecular and cellular tools to investigate the recruitment of two substrate kinases, RSK1 and MK2, to three MAPKs (ERK2, p38α, and ERK5). Unexpectedly, we identified that kinase heterodimers form structurally and functionally distinct complexes depending on the activation state of the MAPK. These may be incompatible with downstream signaling, but naturally they may also form structures that are compatible with the phosphorylation of the downstream kinase at the activation loop, or alternatively at other allosteric sites. Furthermore, we show that small-molecule inhibitors may affect the quaternary arrangement of kinase heterodimers and thus influence downstream signaling in a specific manner.",

      "abstract": "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is the canonical enzyme for investigating how distinct structural elements influence enzyme catalytic activity. Although it is recognized that dynamics are essential for PTP1B function, the data collected thus far have not resolved whether distinct elements are dynamically coordinated or, alternatively, whether they fulfill their respective functions independently. To answer this question, we performed a comprehensive 13C-methyl relaxation study of Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV) residues of PTP1B, which, because of its substantially increased sensitivity, provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of protein motions on different time scales for enzyme function. We discovered that PTP1B exhibits dynamics at three distinct time scales. First, it undergoes a distinctive slow motion that allows for the dynamic binding and release of its two most N-terminal helices from the catalytic core. Second, we showed that PTP1B 13C-methyl group side chain fast time-scale dynamics and 15N backbone fast time-scale dynamics are fully consistent, demonstrating that fast fluctuations are essential for the allosteric control of PTP1B activity. Third, and most importantly, using 13C ILV constant-time Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation measurements experiments, we demonstrated that all four catalytically important loops-the WPD, Q, E, and substrate-binding loops-work in dynamic unity throughout the catalytic cycle of PTP1B. Thus, these data show that PTP1B activity is not controlled by a single functional element, but instead all key elements are dynamically coordinated. Together, these data provide the first fully comprehensive picture on how the validated drug target PTP1B functions.",

Interestingly, Ertiprotafib reduces the melting temperature of PTP1B in differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, different from most drugs that increase the stability of their target upon binding. No molecular data on how Ertiprotafib functions has been published. Thus, to gain molecular insights into the mode of action of Ertiprotafib, we used biomolecular NMR spectroscopy to characterize the molecular details of the PTP1B:Ertiprotafib interaction. Our results show that Ertiprotafib induces aggregation of PTP1B in a concentration dependent manner.

Activating protein 1 transcription factors are phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in their transactivation domains (TAD) at so-called phosphoswitches, which are a hallmark in response to growth factors, cytokines or stress. We show that the ATF2 TAD is controlled by functionally distinct signaling pathways (JNK and p38) through structurally different MAPK binding sites. Moreover, JNK mediated phosphorylation at an evolutionarily more recent site diminishes p38 binding and made the phosphoswitch differently sensitive to JNK and p38 in vertebrates. Structures of MAPK-TAD complexes and mechanistic modeling of ATF2 TAD phosphorylation in cells suggest that kinase binding motifs and phosphorylation sites line up to maximize MAPK based co-regulation.

However, a comprehensive molecular understanding of how these cognate upstream kinases bind and activate p38 is still missing. Here, we combine NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to define the binding interface between full-length MKK6 and p38. It was shown that p38 engages MKK6 not only via its hydrophobic docking groove, but also influences helix αF, a secondary structural element that plays a key role in organizing the kinase core. It was also shown that, unlike MAPK phosphatases, the p38 conserved docking (CD) site is much less affected by MKK6 binding. Finally, it was demonstrated that these interactions with p38 are conserved independent of the MKK6 activation state. Together, the results revealed differences between specificity markers of p38 regulation by upstream kinases, which do not effectively engage the CD site, and downstream phosphatases, which require the CD site for productive binding.",
