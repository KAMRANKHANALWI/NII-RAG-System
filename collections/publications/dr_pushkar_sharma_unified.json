      "abstract": "Malaria parasite undergoes interesting developmental transition in human and mosquito host. While it divides asynchronously in the erythrocytes, it switches to sexual forms, which is critical for disease transmission. We report a novel signalling pathway involving Protein Phosphatase PfPPM2, which regulates asexual division of Plasmodium falciparum as well as its conversion to sexual forms. PfPPM2 may regulate the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in chromatin remodelling and protein translation. One of the key PfPPM2-targets was Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a regulator of heritable gene silencing which contributes to both mitotic proliferation as well as sexual commitment of the parasite. PfPPM2 promotes sexual conversion by regulating the interaction between HP1, H3K9me3 and chromatin and it achieves this by dephosphorylating S33 of HP1. PfPPM2 also regulates protein synthesis in the parasite by repressing the phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2α, which is likely to contribute to parasite division and possibly sexual differentiation.",

However, the mechanisms that regulate cell cycle-related neuronal apoptosis are poorly understood. We identified several miRNA that are dysregulated in neurons from a transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model for AD (TgAD). Several of these miRNA are known to and/or are predicted to target cell cycle-related genes. Detailed investigation on miR-449a revealed the following: a, it promotes neuronal differentiation by suppressing the neuronal cell cycle; b, its expression in cortical neurons was impaired in response to amyloid peptide Aβ42; c, loss of its expression resulted in aberrant activation of the cell cycle leading to apoptosis. miR-449a may prevent cell cycle-related neuronal apoptosis by targeting cyclin D1 and protein phosphatase CDC25A, which are important for G1-S transition. Importantly, the lentiviral-mediated delivery of miR-449a in TgAD mouse brain significantly reverted the defects in learning and memory, which are associated with AD.",

      "abstract": "Signalling pathways in malaria parasite remain poorly defined and major reason for this is the lack of understanding of the function of majority of parasite protein kinases and phosphatases in parasite signalling and its biology. In the present study, we have elucidated the function of Protein Kinase 2 (PfPK2), which is known to be indispensable for the survival of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We demonstrate that it is involved in the invasion of host erythrocytes, which is critical for establishing infection. In addition, PfPK2 may also be involved in the maturation of the parasite post-invasion. PfPK2 regulates the release of microneme proteins like Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), which facilitates the formation of Tight Junction between the merozoite and host erythrocyte- a key step in the process of invasion. Comparative phosphoproteomics studies revealed that PfPK2 may be involved in regulation of several key proteins involved in invasion and signalling. Furthermore, PfPK2 regulates the generation of cGMP and the release of calcium in the parasite, which are key second messengers for the process of invasion. These and other studies have shed light on a novel signalling pathway in which PfPK2 acts as an upstream regulator of important cGMP-calcium signalling, which plays an important role in parasite invasion.",

      "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are important second messengers that regulate key cellular processes in eukaryotes. While it is known that a single phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) catalyses the formation of 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIPs) in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, how its activity and PI3P formation is regulated has remained unknown. Present studies involving a unique Vps15 like protein (TgVPS15) in Toxoplasma gondii provides insight into the regulation of phosphatidyl-3-phosphate (PI3P) generation and unravels a novel pathway that regulates parasite development. Detailed investigations suggested that TgVPS15 regulates PI3P formation in Toxoplasma gondii, which is important for the inheritance of the apicoplast-a plastid like organelle present in most apicomplexans and parasite replication. Interestingly, TgVPS15 also regulates autophagy in T. gondii under nutrient-limiting conditions as it promotes autophagosome formation. For both these processes, TgVPS15 uses PI3P-binding protein TgATG18 and regulates trafficking and conjugation of TgATG8 to the apicoplast and autophagosomes, which is important for biogenesis of these organelles. TgVPS15 has a protein kinase domain but lacks several key residues conserved in conventional protein kinases. Interestingly, two critical residues in its active site are important for PI3P formation and parasitic functions of this kinase. Collectively, these studies unravel a signalling cascade involving TgVPS15, a novel effector of PI3-kinase in T. gondii and possibly other Apicomplexa, that regulate critical processes like apicoplast biogenesis and autophagy.",

However, the mechanisms whereby PfCDPK7 regulates parasite development remain unknown. Here, we perform quantitative phosphoproteomics and phospholipid analysis and find that PfCDPK7 promotes phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis by regulating two key enzymes involved in PC synthesis, phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) and ethanolamine kinase (EK). In the absence of PfCDPK7, both enzymes are hypophosphorylated and PMT is degraded. We further find that PfCDPK7 interacts with 4'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIPs) generated by PI4-kinase. Inhibition of PI4K activity disrupts the vesicular localization PfCDPK7. P. falciparum PI4-kinase, PfPI4K is a prominent drug target and one of its inhibitors, MMV39048, has reached Phase I clinical trials. Using this inhibitor, we demonstrate that PfPI4K controls phospholipid biosynthesis and may act in part by regulating PfCDPK7 localization and activity. These studies not only unravel a signaling pathway involving PfPI4K/4'-PIPs and PfCDPK7 but also provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of a promising series of candidate anti-malarial drugs.",

The conditional knockdown of Tgondii or Pfalciparum ATG18 (Tg/PfATG18) impaired replication of parasites and resulted in their delayed death.

Furthermore, ATG18 regulates membrane association and apicoplast localization of ATG8. These findings provide insights into a novel noncanonical role of ATG18 in apicoplast inheritance.

PfCDPK1 is critical for asexual development of Plasmodium falciparum, but its precise function and substrates remain largely unknown. Using a conditional knockdown strategy, we here establish that this kinase is critical for the invasion of host erythrocytes. Furthermore, using a multidisciplinary approach involving comparative phosphoproteomics we gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. We identify substrates of PfCDPK1, which includes proteins of Inner Membrane Complex and glideosome-actomyosin motor assembly. Interestingly, PfCDPK1 phosphorylates PfPKA regulatory subunit (PfPKA-R) and regulates PfPKA activity in the parasite, which may be relevant for the process of invasion. This study delineates the signaling network of PfCDPK1 and sheds light on mechanisms via which it regulates invasion.Calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) plays an important role in asexual development of Plasmodium falciparum. Using phosphoproteomics and conditional knockdown of CDPK1, the authors here identify CDPK1 substrates and a cross-talk between CDPK1 and PKA, and show the role of CDPK1 in parasite invasion.",

Recent studies highlight the interplay of this central pathway in a variety of pathophysiological diseases. Although defective autophagy is implicated in melanocyte proliferation and pigmentary disorders, the mechanistic relationship between the 2 pathways has not been elucidated. In this study, we show that autophagic proteins LC3B and ATG4B mediate melanosome trafficking on cytoskeletal tracks. While studying melanogenesis, we observed spatial segregation of LC3B-labeled melanosomes with preferential absence at the dendritic ends of melanocytes. This LC3B labeling of melanosomes did not impact the steady-state levels of these organelles but instead facilitated their intracellular positioning. Melanosomes primarily traverse on microtubule and actin cytoskeletal tracks and our studies reveal that LC3B enables the assembly of microtubule translocon complex. At the microtubule-actin crossover junction, ATG4B detaches LC3B from melanosomal membranes by enzymatic delipidation. Further, by live-imaging we show that melanosomes transferred to keratinocytes lack melanocyte-specific LC3B. Our study thus elucidates a new role for autophagy proteins in directing melanosome movement and reveal the unconventional use of these proteins in cellular trafficking pathways. Such crosstalk between the central cellular function and housekeeping pathway may be a crucial mechanism to balance melanocyte bioenergetics and homeostasis.",

Reactivation of the cell cycle in response to neurotoxic insults leads to neuronal cell death and some cell-cycle-related proteins contribute to the process. p27 kip1 (p27), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, prevents unwarranted cyclin-dependent kinase activation. In this study, we have elucidated a novel mechanism via which p27 promotes apoptosis of neurons stimulated by neurotoxic amyloid peptide Aβ42 (Amyloid β1-42 peptide). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that p27 promotes interaction between Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and cyclin D1, which is induced by Aβ42 in cortical neurons. As a result, Cdk5 is sequestered from its neuronal activator p35 resulting in kinase deactivation. The depletion of p27, which was achieved by specific siRNA, restored Cdk5/p35 interaction by preventing association between Cdk5 and cyclin D1 and also abrogated Aβ42 induced apoptosis of cortical neurons. Furthermore, analysis of cell cycle markers suggested that p27 may play a role in Aβ42 induced aberrant cell cycle progression of neurons, which may result in apoptosis. These findings provide novel insights into how p27, which otherwise performs important neuronal functions, may become deleterious to neurons under neurotoxic conditions.",

      "abstract": "The cell cycle of neurons remains suppressed to maintain the state of differentiation and aberrant cell cycle reentry results in loss of neurons, which is a feature in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Present studies revealed that the expression of microRNA 34a (miR-34a) needs to be optimal in neurons, as an aberrant increase or decrease in its expression causes apoptosis. miR-34a keeps the neuronal cell cycle under check by preventing the expression of cyclin D1 and promotes cell cycle arrest. Neurotoxic amyloid β1-42 peptide (Aβ42) treatment of cortical neurons suppressed miR-34a, resulting in unscheduled cell cycle reentry, which resulted in apoptosis. The repression of miR-34a was a result of degradation of TAp73, which was mediated by aberrant activation of the MEK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by Aβ42. A significant decrease in miR-34a and TAp73 was observed in the cortex of a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD, which correlated well with cell cycle reentry observed in the neurons of these animals. Importantly, the overexpression of TAp73α and miR-34a reversed cell cycle-related neuronal apoptosis (CRNA). These studies provide novel insights into how modulation of neuronal cell cycle machinery may lead to neurodegeneration and may contribute to the understanding of disorders like AD.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways need to be unraveled, which may be achieved by understanding the regulation of effectors of these second messengers. Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family members regulate diverse parasitic processes. Because CDPKs are absent from the host, these kinases are considered as potential drug targets. We have dissected the function of an atypical CDPK from Plasmodium falciparum, PfCDPK7. The domain architecture of PfCDPK7 is very different from that of other CDPKs; it has a pleckstrin homology domain adjacent to the kinase domain and two calcium-binding EF-hands at its N terminus. We demonstrate that PfCDPK7 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 via its pleckstrin homology domain, which may guide its subcellular localization. Disruption of PfCDPK7 caused a marked reduction in the growth of the blood stage parasites, as maturation of rings to trophozoites was markedly stalled. In addition, parasite proliferation was significantly attenuated. These findings shed light on an important role for PfCDPK7 in the erythrocytic asexual cycle of malaria parasites.",

      "abstract": "Members of the phylum Apicomplexa possess a highly conserved molecular motor complex anchored in the parasite pellicle and associated with gliding motility, invasion and egress from infected cells. This machinery, called the glideosome, is structured around the acylated gliding-associated protein GAP45 that recruits the motor complex composed of myosin A and two associated myosin light chains (TgMLC1 and TgELC1). This motor is presumably firmly anchored to the inner membrane complex underneath the plasma membrane via an interaction with two integral membrane proteins, GAP50 and GAP40. To determine if the previously mapped phosphorylation sites on TgGAP45 and TgMLC1 have a direct significance for glideosome assembly and function, a series of phospho-mimetic and phospho-null mutants were generated. Neither the overexpression nor the allelic replacement of TgMLC1 with phospho-mutants impacted on glideosome assembly and parasite motility. TgGAP45 phosphorylation mutants were functionally investigated using a complementation strategy in a TgGAP45 inducible knockout background. The loss of interaction with TgGAP50 by one previously reported GAP45-mutant appeared to depend only on the presence of a remaining competing wild type copy of TgGAP45. Accordingly, this mutant displayed no phenotype in complementation experiments. Unexpectedly, GAP45 lacking the region encompassing the cluster of twelve phosphorylation sites did not impact on its dual function in motor recruitment and pellicle integrity. Despite the extensive phosphorylation of TgMLC1 and TgGAP45, this post-translational modification does not appear to be critical for the assembly and function of the glideosome.",

METHODS: Matrix tablets of nateglinide were prepared in combination with the polymers hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), eudragits, ethyl cellulose and polyethylene oxide and the formulated drug release patterns were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo studies. CONCLUSION: Of the seventeen formulated matrix tablets tested, only one formulation labelled HA-2 that contained 15% HPMC K4M demonstrated release profile we had aimed for. Further, swelling studies and scanning electron microscopic analysis confirmed the drug release mechanism of HA-2. The optimized formulation HA-2 was found to be stable at accelerated storage conditions for 3 months with respect to drug content and physical appearance. Mathematical analysis of the release kinetics of HA-2 indicated a coupling of diffusion and erosion mechanisms. In-vitro release studies and pharmacokinetic in vivo studies of HA-2 in rabbits confirmed the sustained drug release profile we had aimed for.",

In this study, a list of mosquito proteins, which facilitate or inhibit the development of malaria parasites in the midgut, haemolymph and salivary glands of mosquitoes, is compiled.

Here, we demonstrate that neurotoxic agents such as β-amyloid peptide cause aberrant activation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, which promotes the entry of neurons into the cell cycle, resulting in their apoptosis. The MEK-ERK pathway regulates CRNA by elevating the levels of cyclin D1. The increase in cyclin D1 attenuates the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) by its neuronal activator p35. The inhibition of p35-cdk5 activity results in enhanced MEK-ERK signaling, leading to CRNA. These studies highlight how neurotoxic signals reprogram and alter the neuronal signaling machinery to promote their entry into the cell cycle, which eventually leads to neuronal cell death.",

Dissection of events that regulate PfGAP45 may provide insights into how the motor and the glideosome operate. We found that PfGAP45 is phosphorylated in response to Phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium signaling. It is phosphorylated by P. falciparum kinases Protein Kinase B (PfPKB) and Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PfCDPK1), which are calcium dependent enzymes, at S89, S103 and S149. The Phospholipase C pathway influenced the phosphorylation of S103 and S149. The phosphorylation of PfGAP45 at these sites is differentially regulated during parasite development. The localization of PfGAP45 and its association may be independent of the phosphorylation of these sites.

      "abstract": "Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are major effectors of calcium signaling in apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma and Plasmodium and control important processes of the parasite life cycle. Despite recently reported crystal structures of Toxoplasma gondii (Tg)CDPKs, several important questions about their regulation remain unanswered. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)CDPK1 has emerged as a key player in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, as it may be involved in the invasion of the host cells. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies on PfCDPK1 suggested that several residues in the regulatory domain play a dual role, as they seem to contribute to the stabilization of both the active and inactive kinase. Mass spectrometry revealed that PfCDPK1 was autophosphorylated at several sites; some of these were placed at strategic locations and therefore were found to be critical for kinase activation. The N-terminal extension of PfCDPK1 was found to be important for PfCDPK1 activation. Unexpectedly, an ATP binding site in the NTE of PfCDPK1 was identified. Our studies highlight several novel features of PfCDPK1 regulation, which may be shared by other members of the CDPK family. These findings may also aid design of inhibitors against these important targets, which are absent from the host.",

Several parasite protein kinases are themselves phosphorylated on putative regulatory residues, including tyrosines in the activation loop of PfGSK3 and PfCLK3; we show that phosphorylation of PfCLK3 Y526 is essential for full kinase activity. A kinome-wide reverse genetics strategy identified 36 parasite kinases as likely essential for erythrocytic schizogony.

Protein kinases control a wide variety of cellular events in almost all eukaryotes, including modulation of mRNA splicing, transport, and stability. We have identified a novel splicing-related protein kinase from Plasmodium falciparum, PfSRPK1. PfSRPK1 when incubated with parasite nuclear extracts inhibited RNA splicing, suggesting that it may control mRNA splicing in the parasite. PfSR1, a putative splicing factor from P. falciparum, was identified as a substrate of PfSRPK1. PfSR1 interacts with RNA and PfSRPK1 modulates its RNA binding. Early in the parasite development, PfSRPK1 and PfSR1 are present in the nucleus. These studies provide useful insights into the function of two potentially key components of P. falciparum mRNA splicing machinery.",

Our present studies suggest that PfPI3K, a novel phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) in Plasmodium falciparum, is exported to the host erythrocyte by the parasite in an active form. PfPI3K is a versatile enzyme as it can generate various 3'-phosphorylated PIPs. In the parasite, PfPI3K was localized in vesicular compartments near the membrane and in its food vacuole. PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were effective against PfPI3K and were used to study PfPI3K function. We found that PfPI3K is involved in endocytosis from the host and trafficking of hemoglobin in the parasite. The inhibition of PfPI3K resulted in entrapment of hemoglobin in vesicles in the parasite cytoplasm, which prevented its transport to the food vacuole, the site of hemoglobin catabolism. As a result, hemoglobin digestion, which is a source of amino acids necessary for parasite growth, was attenuated and caused the inhibition of parasite growth.",

CDPK4 has emerged as an important enzyme for parasite development, because its gene disruption in rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei causes major defects in sexual differentiation of the parasite ( Billker, O., Dechamps, S., Tewari, R., Wenig, G., Franke-Fayard, B., and Brinkmann, V. (2004) Cell 117, 503-514 ). Despite these findings, it is not very clear how PfCDPK4 or any other PfCDPK is regulated by calcium at the molecular level. We report the biochemical characterization and elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PfCDPK4. PfCDPK4 was detected on gametocyte periphery, and its activity in the parasite was regulated by phospholipase C. Even though the Junction Domain (JD) of PfCDPK4 shares moderate sequence homology with that of the plant CDPKs, it plays a pivotal role in PfCDPK4 regulation as previously reported for some plant CDPKs. The regions of the J-domain involved in interaction with both the kinase domain and the calmodulin-like domain were mapped. We propose a model for PfCDPK regulation by calcium, which may also prove useful for design of inhibitors against PfCDPK4 and other members of the PfCDPK family.",

(2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 27126-27133). Studies carried out to elucidate the function of this pathway suggested that it may be important for erythrocyte invasion. Blocking the function of the upstream activators of this pathway, calmodulin and phospholipase C, resulted in impaired invasion. To evaluate if this signaling cascade controls invasion by regulating PfPKB, inhibitors against this kinase were developed. PfPKB inhibitors dramatically reduced the ability of the parasite to invade erythrocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PfPKB associates with actin-myosin motor and phosphorylates PfGAP45 (glideosome-associated protein 45), one of the important components of the motor complex, which may help explain its role in erythrocyte invasion.",

Subsets of these endosomal proteins possess a highly selective PI3P binding zinc finger motif belonging to the FYVE domain family. We have identified a single FYVE domain-containing protein in Plasmodium falciparum which we term FCP. Expression and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that key residues are involved in specific binding to PI3P. In contrast to FYVE proteins in other organisms, endogenous FCP localizes to a lysosomal compartment, the malaria parasite food vacuole (FV), rather than to cytoplasmic endocytic organelles. Transfections of deletion mutants further indicate that FCP is essential for trophozoite and FV maturation and that it traffics to the FV via a novel constitutive cytoplasmic to vacuole targeting pathway. This newly discovered pathway excludes the secretory pathway and is directed by a C-terminal 44-amino acid peptide domain. We conclude that an FYVE protein that might be expected to participate in vesicle targeting in the parasite cytosol instead has a vital and functional role in the malaria parasite FV.",

Therefore, the mechanism of PfPKB regulation was expected to be different from that of the host and had remained unknown. We have identified calmodulin (CaM) as the regulator of PfPKB activity. A CaM binding domain was mapped in the N-terminal region of PfPKB. CaM, in a calcium-dependent manner, interacts with this domain and activates PfPKB. CaM associates with PfPKB in the parasite and regulates its activity. Furthermore phospholipase C acts as an upstream regulator of this cascade as it facilitates the release of calcium from intracellular stores.

      "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (cdk5), a member of the cdk family, is active mainly in postmitotic cells and plays important roles in neuronal development and migration, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic transmission. In this study we investigated the relationship between cdk5 activity and regulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We report that cdk5 phosphorylates the MAP kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) in vivo as well as the Ras-activated MEK1 in vitro. The phosphorylation of MEK1 by cdk5 resulted in inhibition of MEK1 catalytic activity and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In p35 (cdk5 activator) -/- mice, which lack appreciable cdk5 activity, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of NF-M subunit of neurofilament proteins that correlated with an up-regulation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 activity. The activity of a constitutively active MEK1 with threonine 286 mutated to alanine (within a TPXK cdk5 phosphorylation motif in the proline-rich domain) was not affected by cdk5 phosphorylation, suggesting that Thr286 might be the cdk5/p35 phosphorylation-dependent regulatory site. These findings support the hypothesis that cdk5 and the MAP kinase pathway cross-talk in the regulation of neuronal functions. Moreover, these data and the recent studies of Harada et al. (Harada, T., Morooka, T., Ogawa, S., and Nishida, E. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 453-459) have prompted us to propose a model for feedback down-regulation of the MAP kinase signal cascade by cdk5 inactivation of MEK1.",
