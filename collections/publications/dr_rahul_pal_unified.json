Fertile women exposed to conception over 1224 cycles recorded only one pregnancy at antibody titers of > 50 ng/ml (hCG bioneutralization capacity). The antibody response declines with time; fertility was regained when titers fell to < 35 ng/ml. This study presents evidence of the feasibility of a vaccine for control of human fertility.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antibodies induced by a betahCG vaccine in women are competent to neutralize the luteotropic action of hCG. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Hospitals and a laboratory at an academic center. PATIENT(S): Six immunized and three control women of reproductive age, participating in a clinical testing of betahCG contraceptive vaccine. INTERVENTION(S): Increasing doses of hCG simulating early pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Anti-hCG antibody titers, serum progesterone and urinary hCG levels, and onset of menses. RESULT(S): Administration of hCG to mimic early pregnancy sustained serum progesterone concentrations and extended the luteal phase in control women. In contrast, serum progesterone levels declined and the luteal phase was not extended if prevailing antibody titers were > or =40 ng/mL in women who had been immunized with a betahCG based vaccine. No booster effect was seen in anti-hCG titers after hCG challenge. CONCLUSION(S): Antibodies elicited by a betahCG vaccine inactivate hCG and prevent the hormone from rescuing corpus luteum, resulting in progesterone fall and normal menses. Lack of booster in the antibody response confirms the reversibility of the approach.",

Previous work in our laboratory using mouse model systems had revealed that both epitope spreading and inherent cross-reactivity between ribonucleoproteins contributes to the observed multiple specificities in autoimmune sera. We have now extended these studies to human autoimmune responses. Using purified polyclonal and mAbs derived from SLE patients, cross-reactivity between Ro60 and SmD was demonstrated. The cross-reactive epitope was mapped to nonhomologous regions on Ro60(481-505) and SmD(88-102). Five mAbs specifically recognized apoptotic cells, demonstrated variable levels of cross-reactivity toward other nonhomologous ribonucleoprotein targets and bound multiple, nonoverlapping and nonhomologous epitopes on Ro60. Our study demonstrates that cross-reactivity between frequently targeted autoantigens is an important aspect of human systemic autoimmune responses. The presence of multiple cross-reactive epitopes on Ro60 might be important for the generation of anti-Ro60 Ab in SLE patients and in normal individuals displaying no evidence of clinical disease.",

A human monoclonal antibody demonstrating exquisite specificity towards late-stage apoptotic cells was generated from an SLE patient. Polyreactive recognition of ribonucleoproteins Ro52 and Ro60 was observed. The antibody significantly diminished the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and a concomitant decrease in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) secretion was observed. Light and heavy chain sequencing revealed the antibody to be in essentially germline configuration. Elicited anti-idiotypic antibodies bound distinct self-antigens and showed augmented reactivity towards apoptotic cells as well. Thus, near-germline encoded antibodies recognizing antigens externalized during the process of apoptosis can mediate a variety of potentially pathogenic effects; decreases in the phagocytic uptake of dying cells would constitute a disease-perpetuating event and stimulation of the idiotypic network could lead to intermolecular epitope spreading, increasing the range of molecular targets..",

      "abstract": "Enhanced cell death and deficient clearance of cellular debris are thought to contribute to increased self-antigen exposure in systemic autoimmune disease. To investigate the characteristics of early humoral autoimmune responses, six monoclonal antibodies were generated from two autoimmune prone strains of mice. All antibodies specifically bound the surface of late-stage apoptotic cells. Similar antibody reactivities were present in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. While IgM antibodies significantly reduced the phagocytic uptake of apoptotic thymocytes, IgG antibodies enhanced uptake. Poly-reactivity was demonstrated in the recognition of ribonucleoproteins and lipids. An antibody reactive towards lysophosphatidylcholine reversed lysophosphatidylcholine-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production and adversely affected the transmigration of phagocytes towards an apoptotic stimulus. In several instances, CDR were characterized by the accumulation of somatic mutations. Anti-idiotypic antibodies generated upon immunization bound distinct cellular moieties and self-antigens. Poly-specific, apoptotic cell-reactive autoantibodies can therefore directly impact upon the course of disease by influencing phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells, by inducing a pro-inflammatory environment through neutralization of bioactive lipids, by blinding phagocytes to the presence of dying cells through the negation of lipidic chemotactic signals, and by mediating diversification of the humoral autoimmune response via the idiotypic network.",

      "abstract": "The release of hemoglobin (Hb) occurs in some infectious and autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation. As levels of haptoglobin (Hp) fall, free Hb can cause pathology. Humoral autoreactivity to human Hb was demonstrated in the sera of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leishmania and malaria patients. Serum anti-murine Hb antibody levels in lupus-prone mice also exhibited an age-dependent increase, with progressive organ sequestration; significant isotypic correlation was observed with anti-dsDNA antibodies. A suggestive link between anti-Hb and anti-Sm responses was observed: Human lupus sera expressing anti-Sm antibody reactivity preferentially contained heightened levels of anti-Hb autoantibodies, and immunization of lupus-prone mice with Sm led to enhanced anti-murine Hb reactivity. Human and murine anti-Hb monoclonal antibodies were generated, some of which were preferentially reactive toward disease-associated methemoglobin. Epitope-mapping studies revealed evidence of intra-molecular cross-reactivity. One such autoantibody synergized with Hb to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines while eliciting the increased production of monocyte migratory signals from endothelial cells. Preferential usage of specific variable region gene segments was not observed, although somatic mutations were documented. These studies reveal that, while the etiology, specificity and sequences of anti-Hb autoreactive antibodies can vary, they occur quite frequently and can have inflammatory consequences.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has essential roles in pregnancy. Reports linking hCG in non-trophoblastic tumors with poor patient prognosis has spurred interest in patho-physiological roles the hormone might play. METHODS: The ability of hCG to prevent tumor cell death and sustain viability in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed and potential synergies with TLR ligands explored. hCG-induced up-modulation of genes involved in chemoresistance was documented and targets validated by siRNA knock-down. Whether hCG could drive collaboration between tumor cells and macrophages in the production of IL-6 and consequent chemoresistance was assessed. The effects of concurrent anti-hCG immunization and chemotherapy on the growth of syngeneic murine tumors were evaluated. RESULTS: hCG maintained basal levels of cytokine secretion by tumor cells exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs, and enhanced viability and proliferation; pre-treatment with hCG also decreased apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin-V binding and the cleavage of caspase 3. While co-incubation with hCG along with several TLR ligands mediated heightened chemo-resistance, TLR-2/6 and TLR-9 ligands increased the phosphorylation of JNK, and TLR-2 and TLR-8 ligands the phosphorylation of ERK in presence of hCG and curcumin, providing evidence of tri-molecular synergy. The hormone increased the transcription and/or expression of molecular intermediates (SURVIVIN, HIF-1α, PARP-1, Bcl-2, c-FLIP, KLK-10, XIAP, c-IAP-1) associated with chemo-resistance and increased levels of stress modulators (PON2, HO-1, HSP27 and NRF-2). siRNAs to SURVIVIN, NRF-2, HO-1 and HIF-1α attenuated hCG-mediated chemo-resistance. hCG-conditioned tumor cell supernatants induced heightened secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from peripheral blood adherent cells and secreted IL-6 imparted chemo-resistance to naïve tumor cells. Co-administration of curcumin along with an anti-hCG vaccine (hCGβ conjugated to Tetanus Toxoid (TT)) to mice carrying syngeneic tumors resulted in significantly enhanced benefits on animal survival; synergy was demonstrated between anti-hCG antibodies and curcumin in the reduction of tumor cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that hCG, via direct as well as collaborative effects with TLR ligands and accessory cell-secreted cytokines, mediates chemo-resistance in gonadotropin-sensitive tumors and outlines the potential benefits of combination therapy.",

The biological properties of initiator, disease-specific IgM antibodies that specifically recognize apoptotic cells, readily detected in the sera of lupus patients, remain unclear. Apoptotic cell-reactive IgM monoclonal antibodies (generated from lupus-prone mice), as opposed to control IgM, preferentially stimulated maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) derived from such mice, relative to BMDCs derived from healthy mice. An influence of both antibody specificity and cell genotype was also apparent in the secretion of signature inflammatory cytokines. Immunization of such antibodies in lupus-prone animals induced increases in total serum IgG levels, with the elicited antibodies also preferentially recognizing moieties on dying cells. An expanded specificity was apparent both upon Western blot on cellular lysate and from the enhanced recognition of dsDNA, Ro60, RNP68 and Sm; the antibody most efficient in mediating autoreactive diversity, while being germline encoded, also induced the highest degree of phenotypic changes on BMDCs. Apoptotic cell-reactive IgM antibodies may therefore be potentially capable of influencing the course of systemic autoimmune disease by affecting both innate and adaptive immunity.",

      "abstract": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone essential for pregnancy, is also ectopically expressed by a variety of cancers and is associated with poor prognosis; molecular mechanisms which may contribute to tumor progression remain ill-defined. Exogenous hCG enhanced the viability of human colorectal and lung cancer cells and promoted the growth of syngeneic tumors in mice. It induced the synthesis of VEGF, IL-8, matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, and increased invasiveness in an MMP-dependent manner. While inducing the secretion of the tumor-associated extra-cellular matrix proteoglycan versican from tumor cells, hCG consequently caused the TLR-2-mediated generation of the inflammatory, tumor-associated cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 from peripheral blood adherent cells. The molecule up-modulated the Treg-associated transcription factor FOXP3 in tumor cells and increased the secretion of TGFβ and IL-10, thereby inhibiting T cell proliferation and inducing the differentiation FOXP3- CD4+ CD25- cells into functional FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25+ suppressor cells. Co-culture of hCG-treated tumor cells with mature bone-marrow derived dendritic cells induced the generation of active indoleamine deoxygenase. While anti-hCG antibodies restricted the growth of implanted tumor cells in nude mice, immunization of immune competent mice with a βhCG-TT conjugate supplemented with Mycobacterium indicus pranii provided synergistic survival benefit in animals implanted with syngeneic, hCG-responsive tumor cells. These studies elucidate the pathways by which hCG can promote tumorigenesis, providing further rationale for anti-hCG vaccination in the treatment of gonadotropin-sensitive tumors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Apoptotic blebs (as opposed to cellular lysate) enhanced preferentially the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) from bone marrow precursors drawn from lupus-prone mice. Murine, somatically mutated, apoptotic cell-reactive immunoglobulin (Ig)G monoclonal antibodies demonstrated enhanced recognition of DCs and also displayed a prominent lupus strain-specific bias in mediating DC maturation. Further, immunization of such antibodies specifically in lupus-prone mice resulted in widespread humoral autoreactivity; hypergammaglobulinaemia (a hallmark of systemic autoimmunity) was observed, accompanied by enhanced antibody titres to cellular moieties. Induced antibodies recognized antigens distinct from those recognized by the antibodies employed for immunization; in particular, nephritis-associated anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibodies and neonatal lupus-associated anti-Ro60 antibodies were elicited by a non-dsDNA, non-Ro60 reactive antibody, and Sm was a favoured target. Further, only in lupus-prone mice did such immunization enhance the kinetics of humoral anti-self responses, resulting in the advanced onset of glomerulosclerosis. These studies reveal that preferential innate and humoral recognition of the products of cell death in a lupus milieu influence the indices associated with autoimmune pathology.",

METHOD OF STUDY: BeWo cells on treatment with forskolin/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were studied for cell fusion by desmoplakin I+II staining and/or hCG secretion by ELISA. Levels of Wnt10b/β-catenin/glial cell missing a (GCMa)/syncytin-1 were studied by qPCR/Western blotting in forskolin-/hCG-treated control siRNA and Wnt10b silenced BeWo cells. RESULTS: BeWo cells on treatment with hCG (5 IU/mL) led to a 94-fold increase in Wnt10b transcript. Wnt10b silencing showed significant decrease in forskolin-/hCG-mediated BeWo cell fusion and/or hCG secretion. It led to down-regulation of β-catenin (nuclear and cytoplasmic), GCMa and syncytin-1 expression. Treatment of BeWo cells with H89, protein kinase A (PKA) signaling inhibitor, significantly reduced forskolin-/hCG-induced Wnt10b, β-catenin, and syncytin-1 expression, which also resulted in reduced cell fusion. CONCLUSION: Wnt10b is involved in forskolin/hCG-mediated BeWo cell fusion via β-catenin/GCMa/syncytin pathway, which may also involve activation of PKA.",

      "abstract": "Hemolysis-associated anemia is characteristic of diseases such as atherosclerosis, lupus, malaria, and leishmaniasis; the toxic effects of free hemoglobin (Hb) have been extensively described. This study was based on the premise that release of this sequestered, inflammatory molecule can result in deleterious immunological consequences, particularly in the context of pre-existing lupus. IgG anti-Hb responses were detected in the sera of lupus patients. Lupus-prone mice exhibited heightened plasma Hb levels, and ferric (Fe3+) Hb triggered preferential release of lupus-associated cytokines from splenocytes derived from aging lupus-prone mice. Anti-Hb B cell precursor frequencies were heightened in such mice, which also expressed increased titers of anti-Hb antibodies in serum and in kidney eluates. Fe3+ Hb preferentially increased the functional maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from lupus-prone mice, effects abrogated upon the inhibition of Stat3. Hb interacted with lupus-associated autoantigens extruded during apoptosis and coincubation of Hb and apoptotic blebs had additional maturation-inducing effects on lupus BMDCs. Immunization with Hb in lupus-prone mice induced antigen spreading to lupus-associated moieties; Hb-interacting autoantigens were preferentially targeted and increased complement deposition and glomerulosclerosis were observed. Hb therefore demonstrates both antigenicity and immunogenicity and triggers specific immuno-pathological effects in a lupus milieu.",

Though exogenous hCG elicits the synthesis of molecules associated with angiogenesis, invasion, immune suppression and chemoresistance from responsive tumor cells in vitro, the influence of cell-extrinsic βhCG on tumorigenesis in vivo has not been adequately explored. Female C57BL/6-/- × FVBβhCG/- F1 transgenic mice demonstrated ovarian hyperplasia and pituitary adenomas; transcripts of hCG-driven, tumor-associated molecules were heightened in the pituitary. Upon the implantation of Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells (murine lung tumor cells derived from C57BL/6 mice) in transgenic mice, tumor incidence and volume were enhanced, and increased transcription and expression of hCG-driven, tumor-associated molecules was observed in excised tumors. While treatment of these mice with Cabergoline (a potent dopamine receptor agonist) had no significant effects, ovariectomy resulted in a reduction in the lag phase, accompanied by an increase in tumor incidence and volume upon Lewis Lung Carcinoma cell implantation. In tumors derived from Lewis Lung Carcinoma cell-implanted ovariectomized, transgenic mice, the transcription and expression of hCG-driven, tumor-associated molecules remained elevated and enhanced animal mortality was observed. Cell-extrinsic βhCG can therefore induce pro-tumorigenic effects in vivo (even on tumor lineages not part of the reproductive axis), with ovarian products mediating an ameliorating influence.",

      "abstract": "Immunopathological outcomes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE; or lupus) are believed to be autoantibody-mediated. Conditions which promote a Th2 skew (such as pregnancy) should encourage antibody production, worsening antibody-mediated diseases while ameliorating Th1/Th17-mediated diseases. Although an increased propensity toward autoreactivity can be observed in pregnant lupus patients and in pregnant lupus-prone mice, whether a unique human pregnancy-specific factor can contribute to such effects is unknown. This study assessed whether human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, a pregnancy-specific hormone of diverse function) at physiological concentrations could mediate stimulatory influences on immune parameters in non-pregnant, lupus-prone mice, in light of the hormone's ameliorating effects on Th1-mediated autoimmunity in murine models. Results demonstrate that administration of hCG heightened global autoreactivity in such mice; antibodies to dsDNA, RNP68, Protein S, Protein C, β2-glycoprotein 1, and several phospholipids were enhanced, and hormone administration had adverse effects on animal survival. Specifically in splenic cell cultures containing cells derived from lupus-prone mice, hCG demonstrated synergistic effects with TLR ligands (up-modulation of costimulatory markers on B cells) as well as with TCR stimuli (enhanced proliferative responses, enhanced levels of cytokines, and the phosphorylation of p38). In both instances, enhanced synthesis of lupus-associated cytokines was observed, in addition to the heightened generation of autoantibodies reactive toward apoptotic blebs. These results suggest that selective transducive, proliferative, and differentiative effects of hCG on adaptive immune cells may drive autoreactive responses in a lupus environment, and may also potentially provide insights into the association between the presence of higher hCG levels (or the administration of hCG) with the presence (or appearance) of humoral autoimmunity.",

      "abstract": "Haemoglobin (Hb) has well-documented inflammatory effects and is normally efficiently scavenged; clearance mechanisms can be overwhelmed during erythrocyte lysis. Whether Hb is preferentially inflammatory in lupus and triggers broad anti-self responses was assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SLE patients secreted higher levels of lupus-associated inflammatory cytokines when incubated with human Hb than did PBMCs derived from healthy donors, an effect negated by haptoglobin. Ferric murine Hb triggered the preferential release of lupus-associated cytokines from splenocytes, B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells isolated from ageing, lupus-prone NZM2410 mice, and also had mitogenic effects on B cells. Pull-downs, followed by mass spectrometry, revealed interactions of Hb with several lupus-associated autoantigens; co-incubation of ferric Hb with apoptotic blebs (structures that contain packaged autoantigens) revealed synergies-in terms of cytokine release and autoantibody production in vitro-that were also restricted to the lupus genotype. Murine ferric Hb activated multiple signalling pathways and, in combination with apoptotic blebs, preferentially triggered MAP kinase signalling specifically in splenocytes isolated from lupus-prone mice. Infusion of murine ferric Hb into lupus-prone mice led to enhanced release of lupus-associated cytokines, the generation of a spectrum of autoantibodies and enhanced-onset glomerulosclerosis. Given that the biased recognition of ferric Hb in a lupus milieu, possibly in concert with lupus-associated autoantigens, triggers inflammatory responses and the generation of lupus-associated cytokines, and also stimulates the generation of potentially pathogenic lupus-associated autoantibodies, neutralization of Hb could have beneficial effects.",

Curiously, increased circulating levels of beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) (a hormonal subunit linked with tumors of several lineages) are also often observed post-menopause. This study describes a previously unidentified interplay between beta-hCG and progesterone in tumorigenesis. Progesterone mediated apoptosis in beta-hCG responsive tumor cells via non-nuclear receptors. The transgenic expression of beta-hCG, particularly in the absence of the ovaries (a mimic of the post-menopausal state) constituted a potent pro-tumorigenic signal. Significantly, the administration of progesterone had significant anti-tumor effects. RNA-seq profiling identified molecular signatures associated with these processes. TCGA analysis revealed correlates between the expression of several newly identified genes and poor prognosis in post-menopausal patients of lung adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma. Specifically in these women, the detection of intra-tumoral/extra-tumoral beta-hCG may serve as a useful prognostic indicator, and treatment with progesterone on its detection may prove beneficial.",

      "abstract": "Women of reproductive age demonstrate an increased incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus, and reproductive hormones have been implicated in disease progression. Additionally, pregnancy can be associated with disease \"flares\", the reasons for which remain obscure. While apoptotic bodies are believed to provide an autoantigenic trigger in lupus, whether autoantigenic constituents vary with varying cellular insults, and whether such variations can be immunologically consequential in the context of pregnancy, remains unknown. As assessed by antigenicity and mass spectrometry, apoptotic bodies elicited by different drugs demonstrated the differential presence of lupus-associated autoantigens, and varied in the ability to elicit lupus-associated cytokines from lupus splenocytes and alter the phenotype of lupus B cells. Immunization of tamoxifen-induced apoptotic bodies in lupus-prone mice generated higher humoral autoreactive responses than did immunization with cisplatin-induced apoptotic bodies, and both apoptotic bodies were poorly immunogenic in healthy mice. Incubation of lupus splenocytes (but not healthy splenocytes) with the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) along with tamoxifen-induced apoptotic bodies (but not cisplatin-induced apoptotic bodies) induced increases in the secretion of lupus-associated cytokines and in the up-modulation of B cell phenotypic markers. In addition, levels of secreted autoantibodies (including of specificities linked to lupus pathogenesis) were enhanced. These events were associated with the heightened phosphorylation of several signaling intermediates. Observations suggest that hCG is a potential disease-promoting co-stimulant in a lupus-milieu; when combined with specific apoptotic bodies, it enhances the intensity of multiple lupus-associated events. These findings deepen mechanistic insight into the hormone's links with autoreactive responses in lupus-prone mice and humans.",
