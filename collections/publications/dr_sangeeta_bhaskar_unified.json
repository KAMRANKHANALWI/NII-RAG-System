      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the deadliest infectious diseases over the centuries, killing more people worldwide than any other single infectious disease. There is an urgent need for additional strategies which can expedite efforts to combat TB including a preventive vaccine. In this endeavour, we have developed a protocol for a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in India that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two TB vaccines; namely, VPM1002 and Immuvac (M.w) (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii) (MIP) among healthy household contacts (HHCs) of sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In the three-arm randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial study protocol, a total of 12 000 HHCs (aged 6-99 years) of sputum smear-positive PTB patients will be randomised to receive either of the two vaccine candidates VPM1002 and MIP or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is the prevention of microbiologically confirmed TB. Secondary endpoints will include (1) prevention against Latent TB infection, (2) incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in study participants, (3) efficacy of vaccine in prevention of PTB/extra PTB in different age groups (6-18 years, 19-35 years, 36-60 years and above 60 years) and (4) immunogenicity of VPM1002 and MIP at month 2 and month 6 after first vaccination in terms of flow cytometric analysis of M.Tb specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting cytokines and Luminex assays for the presence of different cytokines in the sera and supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures stimulated with whole cell lysates of M.Tb and subsequently similar analysis for the cases who develop TB postvaccination during the follow-up period.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The evolving tumor secretes various immunosuppressive factors that reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) to become immunologically cold. Consequently, various immunosuppressive cells like Tregs are recruited into the TME which in turn subverts the anti-tumor response of dendritic cells and T cells.Tumor immunotherapy is a popular means to rejuvenate the immunologically cold TME into hot. Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) has shown strong immunomodulatory activity in different animal and human tumor models and has been approved for treatment of lung cancer (NSCLC) patients as an adjunct therapy. Previously, MIP has shown TLR2/9 mediated activation of antigen presenting cells/Th1 cells and their enhanced infiltration in mouse melanoma but the underlying mechanism by which it is modulating these immune cells is not yet known. RESULTS: This study reports for the first time that MIP immunotherapy involves type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling as one of the major signaling pathways to mediate the antitumor responses. Further, it was observed that MIP therapy significantly influenced frequency and activation of different subsets of T cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8+ T cells in the TME. It reduces the migration of Tregs into the TME by suppressing the expression of CCL22, a Treg recruiting chemokine on DCs and this process is dependent on type 1 IFN. Simultaneously, in a type 1 IFN dependent pathway, it enhances the activation and effector function of the immunosuppressive tumor resident DCs which in turn effectively induce the proliferation and effector function of the CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: This study also provides evidence that MIP induced pro-inflammatory responses including induction of effector function of conventional dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells along with reduction of intratumoral Treg frequency are essentially mediated in a type 1 IFN-dependent pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cancer associated morbidity is mostly attributed to the dissemination of tumor cells from their primary niche into the circulation known as \"metastasis\". Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) an approved immunotherapeutic agent against lung cancer (NSCLC) has shown potent anti-tumor activity in prior studies. While evaluating anti-tumor activity of MIP in mouse model, MIP treated animals typically exhibited less metastatic lesions in their pulmonary compartment. To study the role of MIP in metastasis closely, B16F10 melanoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in the mice, and the dissemination of tumor cells from the solid tumor was evaluated over a period of time. When B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with MIP in vitro, downregulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition markers was observed in these cells, which in turn suppressed the invasion, migration and adhesion of tumor cells. Notably, MIP therapy was found to be effectively reducing the metastatic burden in murine model of melanoma. Molecular characterization of MIP treated tumor cells substantiated that MIP upregulates the PPARγ expression within the tumor cells, which attenuates the NFκB/p65 levels within the nucleus, resulting in the suppression of Mmp9 expression in tumor cells. Besides that, MIP also downregulated the surface expression of chemokine receptor CXCR4 in murine melanoma cells, where chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the impeded recruitment of p50 and c-Rel factors to the Cxcr4 promoter, resulting in its downregulation transcriptionally. Taken together, MIP suppressed the dissemination of tumor cells in vivo, by regulating the expression of MMP9 and CXCR4 on these cells.",

      "abstract": "Targeting immunotherapeutics inside the tumor microenvironment (TME) with intact biological activity remains a pressing issue. Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), an approved adjuvant therapy for leprosy has exhibited promising results in clinical trials of lung (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. Whole MIP as well as its cell wall fraction have shown tumor growth suppression and enhanced survival in mice model of melanoma, when administered peritumorally. Clinically, peritumoral delivery remains a procedural limitation. In this study, a tumor targeted delivery system was designed, where chitosan nanoparticles loaded with MIP adjuvants, when administered intravenously showed preferential accumulation within the TME, exploiting the principle of enhanced permeability and retention effect. Bio-distribution studies revealed their highest concentration inside the tumor after 6 h of administration. Interestingly, MIP adjuvant nano-formulations significantly reduced the tumor volume in the treated groups and increased the frequency of activated immune cells inside the TME. For chemoimmunotherapeutics studies, MIP nano-formulation was combined with standard dosage regimen of Paclitaxel. Combined therapy exhibited a further reduction in tumor volume relative to either of the MIP nano formulations. From this study a three-pronged strategy emerged as the underlying mechanism; chitosan and Paclitaxel have shown direct role in tumor cell death and the MIP nano-formulation activates the tumor residing immune cells which ultimately leads to the reduced tumor growth.",

      "abstract": "TB-IRIS is an abnormal inflammatory response in a subset of HIV-TB co-infected patients shortly after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Therapy in these patients could have greatly improved the life expectancy as ART reconstitutes the function and number of CD4+ T cells and many patients see improvement in symptoms but paradoxically up to 54% of co-infected patients develop TB-IRIS. Different studies have indicated that both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in the pathology of IRIS but the role of macrophages in abnormal activation of CD4+ T cells is poorly understood. Since macrophages are one of the major antigen-presenting cells and are infected by M.tb at a high frequency, they are very much likely to be involved in the development of TB-IRIS. In this study, we have developed a mouse model of experimental IRIS, in which M.tb-infected T-cell knockout mice undergo a fatal inflammatory disease after CD4+ T cell reconstitution. Lung macrophages and blood monocytes from M.tb-infected TCRβ-/- mice showed upregulated expression of cell surface activation markers and also showed higher mRNA expression of inflammation-associated chemokines and matrix metalloproteases responsible for tissue damage. Furthermore, cytokine and TLR signaling feedback mechanism to control excessive inflammation was also found to be dysregulated in these macrophages under lymphopenic conditions. Previous studies have shown that hyperactive CD4+ T cells are responsible for disease induction and our study shows that somehow macrophages are in a higher activated state when infected with M.tb in an immune-deficient condition, which results in excessive activation of the adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of TB-IRIS would facilitate identification of prospective biomarkers for disease development in HIV-TB co-infected patients before starting antiretroviral therapy.",

Immunologic compartmentalization of the lungs into airway lumen and interstitium has paved the way to determine the immune status of the site of pathogen entry, which is crucial for the outcome of any air-borne infections. Vaccination via the nasal route with Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a prospective candidate vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), has been reported to confer superior protection as compared to the subcutaneous (s.c.) route in small-animal models of TB. However, the immune mechanism remains only partly understood. Here, we showed that intranasal (i.n.) immunization of mice with MIP resulted in a significant recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing activation markers in the lung airway lumen. A strong memory T-cell response was observed in the lung airway lumen after i.n. MIP vaccination, compared with s.c. vaccination. The recruitment of these T-cells was regulated primarily by CXCR3-CXCL11 axis in \"MIP i.n.\" group. MIP-primed T-cells in the lung airway lumen effectively transferred protective immunity into naïve mice against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection and helped reducing the pulmonary bacterial burden. These signatures of protective immune response were virtually absent or very low in unimmunized and subcutaneously immunized mice, respectively, before and after M.tb challenge. Our study provides mechanistic insights for MIP-elicited protective response against M.tb infection.",

Studies have shown potential immunomodulatory properties of MIP, the most significant being the ability to induce strong Th1 type of response, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of APCs and lymphocytes, elicitation of M.tb specific poly-functional T cells. All of these form crucial components of host-immune response during M.tb infection. Also, MIP was found to be potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages which resulted in enhanced clearance of M.tb from MIP and M.tb co-infected cells. Hence, we further examined the component/s of MIP responsible for autophagy induction. Interestingly, we found that MIP lipids and DNA were able to induce autophagy but not the protein fraction. LAM being one of the crucial components of mycobacterial cell-wall lipids and possessing the ability of immunomodulation; we isolated LAM from MIP and did a comparative study with M.tb-LAM. Stimulation with MIP-LAM resulted in significantly high secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and displayed high autophagy inducing potential in macrophages as compared to M.tb-LAM. Treatment with MIP-LAM enhanced the co-localization of M.tb within the phago-lysosomes and increased the clearance of M.tb from the infected macrophages. This study describes LAM to be a crucial component of MIP which has significant contribution to its immunotherapeutic efficacy against TB.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) is an atypical mycobacterium species with potent antitumor efficacy. Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells, playing key roles in the activation of antitumor immunity. We have previously shown the potent activation of macrophages and DCs by MIP, which is mediated by MyD88-TLR2 signaling axis. In the present study, we further examined the role of MyD88 and TLR2 in MIP-mediated tumor regression. RESULTS: Wild-type and MyD88-/- mice were implanted with B16F10 tumor cells, treated with MIP or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and monitored for tumor growth. As expected, MIP therapy led to significant tumor regression in wild-type mice. However, antitumor efficacy of MIP was lost in MyD88-/- animals. Both PBS-treated (control) and MIP-treated MyD88-/- mice developed tumors with comparable volume. Since MyD88 relays TLR engagement signals, we analyzed the antitumor efficacy of MIP in TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice. It was observed that MIP therapy reduced tumor burden in wild-type and TLR4-/- mice but not in TLR2-/- mice. Tumor volume in MIP-treated TLR2-/- mice were comparable with those in PBS-treated wild-type animals. These results implicated the MyD88-TLR2 signaling axis in the antitumor efficacy of MIP.",

Hence, there is the need to find an adjuvant that elicits strong Th1 immune response which should be safe when injected in the host along with vaccines. Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a non-pathogenic vaccine candidate, has shown strong immunomodulatory activity in leprosy/tuberculosis/cancer and in genital warts patients where its administration shifted the host immune response towards Th1 type. These findings prompted us to study the components of MIP in detail for their Th1 inducing property. Since mycobacterial cell wall is very rich in immunostimulatory components and is known to play important role in immune modulation, we investigated the activity of MIP cell wall using Ovalbumin antigen (OVA) as model antigen. 'Whole cell wall' (CW) and 'aqueous soluble cell wall fractions' (ACW) induced significant Th1 immune response while 'cell wall skeleton' (CWS) induced strong Th2 type of immune response. Finally, functional activity of fractions having Th1 inducing activity was evaluated in mouse model of melanoma. CW demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity similar to whole MIP. Anti-tumor activity of CW could be correlated with enhanced tumor antigen specific Th1 immune response observed in tumor draining lymph nodes.",

In case of macrophages, recognition of BCG and other mycobacteria has been attributed predominantly to MyD88-dependent singling. Interestingly, in previous study with bone marrow-derived DCs, we have shown that BCG promotes the survival of wild-type and MyD88-/- cells to the comparable levels. In the present study, we further examined MyD88-/- DC's response to BCG. RESULTS: Bone marrow-derived DCs from wild-type and MyD88-/- mice were stimulated with BCG and analyzed for cytokine secretion. As expected, BCG-stimulated wild-type DCs produced significant amount of TNF-α and IL-12p40 in response to BCG. Interestingly, BCG-stimulated MyD88-/- DCs were also found to secret significantly higher levels of TNF-α and IL-12p40, compared with unstimulated DCs. We further observed that wild-type DCs produced significant level of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 in response to BCG, whereas MyD88-/- DCs secreted very low amount of IL-10 when stimulated with BCG.

The process of autophagy has been involved in many physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, there is a developing need to identify, quantify, and manipulate the autophagic process accurately in the cells. As autophagy involves dynamic and complex processes, therefore various approaches are needed to study this process precisely. In this chapter, we have tried to elaborate the approaches and methods to monitor autophagy, with a primary focus on mammalian macroautophagy. Autophagy induction can be detected using Western blotting of LC3 (marker protein for autophagosomes) in which LC3-II levels represent the quantity of autophagosomes formed on induction to a particular stimulus. This can also be confirmed by puncta formation assay using confocal microscopy. Further, the autophagic flux can be examined using bafilomycin A1 as inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and acidification of lysosomal compartments, thereby leading to accumulation of autophagosomes which is represented by high LC3-II levels. The autophagolysosomal degradation or proteolysis which is the last step of autophagy can be analyzed by DQ-BSA assay.",

BCG-mediated protection against TB and bladder cancer has been shown to rely on its ability to induce superior CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. As the magnitude of T cell responses is defined by dendritic cell (DC) lifespan, we examined the effect of BCG on DC survival and its underlying mechanisms. It was observed that BCG stimulation enhanced DC survival and prolonged DC lifespan in a dose-dependent manner. Live BCG led to a higher DC survival compared with heat-killed BCG. FITC-Annexin V staining showed that BCG promoted DC survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Consistently, higher expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were observed in BCG-stimulated DCs. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL drastically reduced the DC survival efficacy of BCG. Comparable survival of BCG-stimulated wild-type and MyD88-/- DCs suggested that MyD88 signaling is dispensable for BCG-induced DC survival. NF-κB is one of the key regulators of innate immune responses. We observed that pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB abrogated BCG-mediated increase in DC survival and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings provide a novel insight into the effect of BCG on DC physiology.",

Higher protective efficacy of MIP against TB as compared to BCG provoked the efforts to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MIP mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Autophagy, initially described as a cell survival mechanism during starvation, also plays a key role in host resistance to M.tb. Virulent mycobacteria like M.tb, suppresses host autophagy response to increase its survival in macrophages. Since mycobacterial species have been shown to vary widely in their autophagy-inducing properties, in the present study, we examined the autophagy inducing efficacy of MIP and its role in MIP-mediated protection against M.tb. MIP was found to be potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages. Induced autophagy was responsible for reversal of the phagosome maturation block and phagolysosome fusion inhibition in M.tb infected macrophages, which ultimately lead to significantly enhanced clearance of M.tb from the macrophages. This is an important study which further delineated the underlying mechanisms for significant immunotherapeutic activity observed in TB patients / animal models of tuberculosis, given MIP therapy along with chemotherapy.",

Sputum smear and culture examinations were performed at different time points. MIP was safe with no adverse effects. While sputum smear conversion did not show any statistically significant difference, significantly higher number of patients (67.1%) in the MIP group achieved sputum culture conversion at fourth week compared to the placebo (57%) group (p = 0.0002), suggesting a role of MIP in clearance of the bacilli.

It has been reported previously that MIP possesses strong immunomodulatory properties and confers protection against experimental TB and tumor. DCs, by virtue of their unmatched antigen-presentation potential, play a critical role in activation of antitumor and antimycobacterial immune response. The effect of MIP on the behavior of DCs and the underlying mechanisms, however, have not been investigated so far. In the present study, we showed that MIP induces significant secretion of IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-10, and TNF-α by DCs and up-regulates the expression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. MIP(L) induced a significantly higher response compared with MIP(K). PI and Annexin V staining showed that MIP increases DC survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Consistently, higher expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl was observed in MIP-stimulated DCs. Cytokines, produced by naïve T cells, cocultured with MIP-stimulated DCs, showed that MIP promotes Th1/Th17 polarization potential in DCs. Response to MIP was lost in MyD88(-/-)DCs, underscoring the critical role of TLRs in MIP-induced DC activation. Further studies revealed that TLR2 and TLR9 are involved in DC activation by MIP(L), whereas MIP(K) activates the DCs through TLR2. Our findings establish the DC activation by MIP, define the behavior of MIP-stimulated DCs, and highlight the role of TLRs in MIP-induced DC activation.",

It is a potent vaccine candidate against tuberculosis, promotes Th1 immune response and protects mice from tumours. In previous studies, we demonstrated higher protective efficacy of MIP against experimental tuberculosis as compared with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Since macrophages play an important role in the pathology of mycobacterial diseases and cancer, in the present study, we evaluated the MIP in live and killed form for macrophage activation potential, compared it with BCG and investigated the underlying mechanisms. High levels of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), IL-6 and nitric oxide were produced by MIP-stimulated macrophages as compared with BCG-stimulated macrophages. Prominent up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 was also observed in response to MIP. Loss of response in MyD88-deficient macrophages showed that both MIP and BCG activate the macrophages in a MyD88-dependent manner. MyD88 signalling pathway culminates in nuclear factor-κB/activator protein-1 (NF-κB/AP-1) activation and higher activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was observed in response to MIP. With the help of pharmacological inhibitors and Toll-like receptor (TLR) -deficient macrophages, we observed the role of TLR2, TLR4 and intracellular TLRs in MIP-mediated macrophage activation. Stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 in homodimeric or heterodimeric form showed that MIP has a distinctly higher level of TLR2 agonist activity compared with BCG. Further experiments suggested that TLR2 ligands are well exposed in MIP whereas they are obscured in BCG.

      "abstract": "Research in cancer immunotherapy has gained momentum in the last two decades, with many studies and clinical trials showing positive therapeutic outcomes. Immunotherapy can elicit not only a strong anticancer immune response which could even control metastases, but could also induce immunological memory, resulting in long-lasting protection in the prophylactic setting and protection against possible recurrence. Nanocarriers offer an attractive means for delivery of a multitude of therapeutic immunomodulators which are readily taken up by immune cells and can initiate a particular arm of an immunostimulatory cascade leading to tumor cell killing. This review focuses on recent advances in nanocarrier-mediated immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo studies as well as clinical progress are discussed in various sections. Description of the specific role of nanoparticle technology in immunotherapy highlights the way particles can be tailor-made in terms of size, structure, payload, and surface properties for active targeting to antigen-presenting cells and/or enhanced accumulation in the solid tumor.",

Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy has shown promising outcomes in recent years. Herein, we report better tumor regression and enhancement of antitumor immune response at the tumor microenvironment by co-delivery of paclitaxel and a TLR4 agonist through a PLGA based nanoparticle preparation (TLNP). Particle characterization showed high encapsulation of both components and retention of their biological activities. In vivo tumor regression studies demonstrated clear benefit of TLNP over the paclitaxel. The mean tumor volume of the TLNP treated animals was found to be 40% less than that of the Paclitaxel treated animals. Flow cytometric analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cells indicated activation of antigen presenting cells and T-cells providing evidence of Th1 immune response. In vivo results are promising and could pave way for novel chemo-immunotherapeutic treatment modality.",

As the current vaccine BCG fails to prevent adult cases of TB, an improved vaccine and/or vaccination strategy is urgently needed to combat TB. Previously we reported the higher protective efficacy of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), formerly known as Mycobacterium w (M.w) as compared to BCG in murine model of TB. In this study we further evaluated the protective efficacy of MIP in guinea pig model of TB. Modulation of post infection immune response was analyzed in the lungs of MIP immunized and control groups. We found reduced bacterial loads, improved pathology and organized granulomatous response at different post infection time points in the MIP-immunized group as compared to the BCG-immunized group. Combined results suggest that MIP-immunization results in heightened protective Th1 response as compared to BCG group, early after infection with M.tb and a balanced Th1 versus immunosuppressive response at late chronic stage of infection. The study demonstrates the higher antigen presenting cells function both inside the granuloma as well as in the single cell suspension of the lung in the MIP-immunized group. We further demonstrate that live MIP is safe to use in vivo as we observed quick clearance of MIP from the body and no untoward reaction was found. Aerosol route of immunization provided higher protection. Further this study provides evidence that MIP-immunization gives significantly better long term protection as compared to BCG against TB.",

So, improved therapeutic strategy is urgently needed. Immunotherapy could be beneficial for the effective management of the disease. Previously we showed the protective efficacy of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) when given as prophylactic vaccine in animal models of tuberculosis. METHODS: We sought to investigate whether MIP can be used as an adjunct to the chemotherapy in guinea pig models of tuberculosis. Efficacy of MIP was evaluated when given subcutaneously or by aerosol. RESULTS: MIP-therapy as an adjunct to the chemotherapy was found to be effective in accelerating bacterial killing and improving organ pathology. MIP-immunotherapy resulted in higher numbers of activated antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes in the infected lungs and also modulated the granulomatous response. Early increase in protective Th1 immune response was observed in the immunotherapy group. Following subsequent doses of MIP, decrease in the inflammatory response and increase in the immunosuppressive response was observed, which resulted in the improvement of lung pathology. CONCLUSION: MIP immunotherapy is a valuable adjunct to chemotherapy for tuberculosis. Aerosol route of immunotherapy can play a crucial role for inducing immediate local immune response in the lung.",

METHODS: We used SP-LPS, a bio-polymer having potent immunostimulatory activity, for conjugation with paclitaxel to make a chemo-immunotherapeutic conjugate. Its physicochemical characterization was done by HPLC, NMR and IR spectra. Stability was measured at different pH, temperature and in tissue homogenates. Chemotherapeutic and immunostimulatory activity was evaluated in vitro and also in tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: The conjugate self assembled into nanoparticulate structure, probably due to micelle formation. Stability was pH and temperature dependent. The conjugate exhibited chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic activity in vitro. In vivo antitumor activity was significantly higher and a higher percentage of activated immune cells were found in the tumor microenvironment of the conjugate-treated mice as compared to Taxol®-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: This conjugate is a potential chemo-immunotherapeutic compound for the treatment of cancer with advantages over present day chemotherapy with Taxol in terms of higher anticancer activity, less toxicity and ease of delivery.",

In the present study, we investigated the adjuvant effect of thermal component of HET immunization in terms of maturation of dendritic cells and its implication on the quality of the immune outcome in terms of antibody production upon HET immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT). We have shown that in vitro hyperthermia exposure at 42°C for 30 minutes up regulates the surface expression of maturation markers on bone marrow derived DCs. This observation correlated in vivo with an increased and accelerated expression of maturation markers on DCs in the draining lymph node upon HET immunization in mice. This effect was found to be independent of the antigen delivered and depends only on the thermal component of HET immunization. In vitro hyperthermia also led to enhanced capacity to stimulate CD4+ T cells in allo MLR and promotes the secretion of IL-10 by BMDCs, suggesting a potential for Th2 skewing of T cell response. HET immunization also induced a systemic T cell response to TT, as suggested by proliferation of splenocytes from immunized animal upon in vitro stimulation by TT. Exposure to heat during primary immunization led to generation of mainly IgG class of antibodies upon boosting, similar to the use of conventional alum adjuvant, thus highlighting the adjuvant potential of heat during HET immunization. Lastly, we have shown that mice immunized by tetanus toxoid using HET route exhibited protection against challenge with a lethal dose of tetanus toxin. Thus, in addition to being a painless, needle free delivery system it also has an immune modulatory potential.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Role of immune system in protecting the host from cancer is well established. Growing cancer however subverts immune response towards Th2 type and escape from antitumor mechanism of the host. Activation of both innate and Th1 type response is crucial for host antitumor activity. In our previous study it was found, that Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) also known as M. w induces Th1 type response and activates macrophages in animal model of tuberculosis. Hence, we studied the immunotherapeutic potential of MIP in mouse tumor model and the underlying mechanisms for its antitumor activity. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Tumors were implanted by injecting B16F10 melanoma cells subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Using the optimized dose and treatment regimes, anti-tumor efficacy of heat killed MIP was evaluated. In MIP treated group, tumor appeared in only 50-60% of mice, tumor growth was delayed and tumor volume was less as compared to control. MIP mediated immune activation was analysed in the tumor microenvironment, tumor draining lymph node and spleen. Induction of Th1 response and higher infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment was observed in MIP treated mice. A large fraction of these immune cells were in activated state as confirmed by phenotypic and functional analysis. Interestingly, percentage of Treg cells in the tumor milieu of treated mice was less. We also evaluated efficacy of MIP along with chemotherapy and found a better response as compared to chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSION: MIP therapy is effective in protecting mice from tumor. It activates the immune cells, increases their infiltration in tumor, and abrogates tumor mediated immune suppression.",

      "abstract": "The prime objective of this study was to develop a combined chemo-immunotherapeutic formulation which could directly kill cancer cells as well as activate the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment to mount a robust antitumor immune response. Paclitaxel (PTX) and SP-LPS (nontoxic derivative of lipopolysaccharide) were selected as anticancer drug and immunostimulant respectively. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based PTX and SP-LPS containing nanoparticles (TLNP) were prepared by the double-emulsion method (w/o/w) and characterized in terms of size, zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The release behavior of PTX and SP-LPS from the TLNP exhibited a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial burst followed by slow continuous release. In vitro anticancer activity of TLNP was found to be higher compared to PTX when studied in a tumor cell-splenocyte coculture system. TLNP activated murine monocytes induced the secretion of various proinflammatory cytokines. After iv administration of TLNP in tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice, the amount of PTX in the tumor mass was found to be higher in TLNP treated mice as compared to commercial Taxol group at all time points studied. In vitro studies suggest that nanoparticles containing PTX and SP-LPS have both direct cytotoxicity and immunostimulatory activity. Hence this might have potential as a chemo-immunotherapeutic formulation against cancer with advantage over present day chemotherapy with Taxol, in terms of tumor targeting, less toxicity and immunostimulation.",

One of the important vaccine strategies is whole bacterial vaccines. This approach relies on multiple antigens and built-in adjuvanticity. Other mycobacterial strains which share cross-reactive antigens with M. tuberculosis have been considered as alternatives to M. bovis for vaccine use. One such strain, \"Mycobacterium w\", had been evaluated for its immunomodulatory properties in leprosy. A vaccine against leprosy based on killed M. w is approved for human use, where it has resulted in clinical improvement, accelerated bacterial clearance, and increased immune responses to Mycobacterium leprae antigens. M. w shares antigens not only with M. leprae but also with M. tuberculosis, and initial studies have shown that vaccination with killed M. w induces protection against tuberculosis in Mycobacterium bovis BCG responder, as well as BCG nonresponder, strains of mice. Hence, we further studied the protective potential of M. w and the underlying immune responses in the mouse model of tuberculosis. We analyzed the protective efficacy of M. w immunization in both live and killed forms through the parenteral route and by aerosol immunization, compared with that of BCG. Our findings provide evidence that M. w has potential protective efficacy against M. tuberculosis. M. w activates macrophage activity, as well as lymphocytes.

      "abstract": "Large-scale validation of a simple latex agglutination test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is described. Soluble antigens extracted from a non-pathogenic saprophytic mycobacterium, Mycobacterium w, which shares antigenic determinants with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were covalently linked to carboxylated polystyrene latex beads. Batch to batch reproducibility of coated latex was ensured. Latex reagents were standardized to overcome non-specific agglutination. Reagents of the test are stable for 1 year at 4 degrees C. A total of 1,058 serum samples of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients or patients with other pulmonary diseases and healthy controls living in endemic areas were tested. Sensitivity of 94% for pulmonary tuberculosis and 87% for extrapulmonary tuberculosis was obtained. Specificity is 92.2% for healthy controls and patients with other respiratory diseases. We conclude that the latex agglutination test can be utilized for mass screening for both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis where diagnosis by existing methods is much more difficult.",

The device can deliver desired number of bacilli (20-2000) in lungs of mice. All safety measures to handle infectious bacteria have been incorporated in the design and it is controlled remotely by a personal computer. It is an indispensable device to study the protective efficacy of vaccine candidates against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This device would also be useful to study immunization and drug delivery by nasal route in experimental animals.",

      "abstract": "A novel ultrasound-enhanced latex agglutination test is described for the detection of serum antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The use of ultrasound to detect the low level of antibodies in serum enhances the sensitivity of the test. The technique is based on the fact that suspended latex particles become concentrated in an ultrasonic standing wave field, thereby increasing the rate of particle-particle collisions compared to the standard agglutination test procedure. Reactions were performed on piezo-ceramic wafers, which were connected to an oscillator at a frequency of 100 kHz. This method improved sensitivity significantly so that even 20 times diluted serum samples exhibited agglutination, which was clearly visible to the naked eye.",
