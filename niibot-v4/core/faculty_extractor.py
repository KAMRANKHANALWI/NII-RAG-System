"""Enhanced Faculty Name Extractor with Multi-Strategy Recognition.

This module provides sophisticated faculty name recognition with comprehensive
pattern matching, designed to work seamlessly with the 5-tier retrieval system.

Key Features:
    - Multi-database name recognition (KNOWN_FACULTY, FIRST_NAMES, AMBIGUOUS_NAMES)
    - Enhanced partial matching for incomplete queries
    - Context validation to prevent false positives
    - Dependency injection pattern for optimal caching
    - Graceful degradation with fallback implementations
